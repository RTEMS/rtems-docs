The .cvs file is exported from a spreadsheet used to track the status
of RTEMS versus various POSIX related standards. The spreadsheet
is maintained and managed outside the RTEMS Documentation. The
spreadsheet is versioned but that is not reflected in the name
"RTEMS-Standards-Compliance.csv". 

The version of the spreadsheet included currently is:

v20 - 1 July 2024

The spreadsheet MUST be exported as "MS-DOS CSV" to be processed by
the Python script.

This is the information in each column:
