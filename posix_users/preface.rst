Preface
#######

This is the User’s Guide for the POSIX API support
provided in RTEMS.

The functionality described in this document is based
on the following standards:

- POSIX 1003.1b-1993.

- POSIX 1003.1h/D3.

- Open Group Single UNIX Specification.

Much of the POSIX API standard is actually implemented in the
Cygnus Newlib ANSI C Library.  Please refer to documentation on
Newlib for more information on the functionality it supplies.

This manual is still under construction and improvements
are welcomed from users.
