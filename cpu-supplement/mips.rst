MIPS Specific Information
*************************

This chapter discusses the MIPS architecture dependencies in this port of
RTEMS.  The MIPS family has a wide variety of implementations by a wide range
of vendors.  Consequently, there are many, many CPU models within it.

CPU Model Dependent Features
============================

This section presents the set of features which vary across MIPS
implementations and are of importance to RTEMS.  The set of CPU model feature
macros are defined in the file ``cpukit/score/cpu/mips/mips.h`` based upon the
particular CPU model specified on the compilation command line.

Memory Model
============

Flat Memory Model
-----------------

The MIPS family supports a flat 32-bit address space with addresses ranging
from 0x00000000 to 0xFFFFFFFF (4 gigabytes).  Each address is represented by a
32-bit value and is byte addressable.  The address may be used to reference a
single byte, word (2-bytes), or long word (4 bytes).  Memory accesses within
this address space are performed in big endian fashion by the processors in
this family.

Some of the MIPS family members such as the support virtual memory and
segmentation.  RTEMS does not support virtual memory or segmentation on any of
these family members.

Interrupt Processing
====================

Although RTEMS hides many of the processor dependent details of interrupt
processing, it is important to understand how the RTEMS interrupt manager is
mapped onto the processor's unique architecture. Discussed in this chapter are
the MIPS's interrupt response and control mechanisms as they pertain to RTEMS.

Vectoring of an Interrupt Handler
---------------------------------

Upon receipt of an interrupt the XXX family members with separate interrupt
stacks automatically perform the following actions:

- TBD

A nested interrupt is processed similarly by these CPU models with the
exception that only a single ISF is placed on the interrupt stack and the
current stack need not be switched.

Interrupt Levels
----------------

TBD

Symmetric Multiprocessing
=========================

SMP is not supported.

Thread-Local Storage
====================

Thread-local storage is not implemented.

Board Support Packages
======================

System Reset
------------

An RTEMS based application is initiated or re-initiated when the processor is
reset.  When the processor is reset, it performs the following actions:

- TBD
