## Application Binary Interface

In 32-bit PowerPC configurations the ABI defined by
[Power Architecture 32-bit Application Binary Interface Supplement 1.0 - Embedded](https://ftp.rtems.org/pub/rtems/people/sebh/Power-Arch-32-bit-ABI-supp-1.0-Embedded.pdf)
is used.

In 64-bit PowerPC configurations the ABI defined by
[Power Architecture 64-Bit ELF V2 ABI Specification, Version 1.1](https://ftp.rtems.org/pub/rtems/people/sebh/ABI64BitOpenPOWERv1.1_16July2015_pub.pdf)
is used.

## Special Registers

The following special-purpose registers are used by RTEMS:

*Special-Purpose Register General 0 (SPRG0)*

: In SMP configurations, this register contains the address of the per-CPU
  control of the processor.

*Special-Purpose Register General 1 (SPRG1)*

: This register contains the interrupt stack pointer for the outer-most
  interrupt service routine.

*Special-Purpose Register General 2 (SPRG2)*

: This register contains the address of interrupt stack area begin.

## Memory Model

The memory model is flat.

## Interrupt Processing

### Interrupt Levels

There are exactly two interrupt levels on PowerPC with respect to RTEMS. Level
zero corresponds to interrupts enabled. Level one corresponds to interrupts
disabled.

### Interrupt Stack

The interrupt stack size can be configured via the
`CONFIGURE_INTERRUPT_STACK_SIZE` application configuration option.

## Symmetric Multiprocessing

SMP is supported. Available platforms are the Freescale QorIQ P series (e.g.
P1020) and T series (e.g. T2080, T4240).

## Thread-Local Storage

Thread-local storage is supported.

## 64-bit Caveats

- The thread pointer is `r13` in contrast to `r2` used in the 32-bit ABI.
- The TOC pointer is `r2`. It must be initialized as part of the C run-time
  setup. A valid stack pointer is not enough to call C functions. They may
  use the TOC to get addresses and constants.
- The TOC must be within the first 2GiB of the address space. This simplifies
  the interrupt prologue, since the `r2` can be set to `.TOC.` via the
  usual `lis` followed by `ori` combination. The `lis` is subject to
  sign-extension.
- The `PPC_REG_LOAD`, `PPC_REG_STORE`, `PPC_REG_STORE_UPDATE`, and
  `PPC_REG_CMP` macros are available for assembly code to provide register
  size operations selected by the GCC `-m32` and `-m64` options.
- The `MSR[CM]` bit must be set all the time, otherwise the MMU translation
  my yield unexpected results. The `EPCR[ICM]` or `EPCR[GICM]` bits may be
  used to enable the 64-bit compute mode for exceptions.
