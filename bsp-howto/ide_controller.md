IDE Controller Driver
*********************

.. warning::

   The ATA/IDE Drivers are out of date and should not be used for new BSPs.
   The preferred alternative is to port the ATA/SATA/SCSI/NVMe support from
   FreeBSD to RTEMS using the `libbsd
   <https://gitlab.rtems.org/rtems/pkg/rtems-libbsd>`_.
   Ask on the mailing list if you plan to write a driver for an ATA/IDE device.

Introduction
============

The IDE Controller driver is responsible for providing an interface to an IDE
Controller.  The capabilities provided by this driver are:

- Read IDE Controller register

- Write IDE Controller register

- Read data block through IDE Controller Data Register

- Write data block through IDE Controller Data Register

The reference implementation for an IDE Controller driver can be found in
``bsps/shared/dev/ide``. This driver is based on the libchip
concept and allows to work with any of the IDE Controller chips simply by
appropriate configuration of BSP. Drivers for a particular IDE Controller chips
locate in the following directories: drivers for well-known IDE Controller
chips locate into ``bsps/shared/dev/ide``
and drivers for custom IDE
Controller chips (for example, implemented on FPGA) locate into
``bsps/${RTEMS_CPU}/${RTEMS_BSP/ata``.  There is a README file in these
directories for each supported IDE Controller chip. Each of these README
explains how to configure a BSP for that particular IDE Controller chip.

Initialization
==============

IDE Controller chips used by a BSP are statically configured into
``IDE_Controller_Table``. The ``ide_controller_initialize`` routine is
responsible for initialization of all configured IDE controller chips.
Initialization order of the chips based on the order the chips are defined in
the ``IDE_Controller_Table``.

The following actions are performed by the IDE Controller driver initialization
routine:

.. code-block:: c

    rtems_device_driver ide_controller_initialize(
      rtems_device_major_number  major,
      rtems_device_minor_number  minor_arg,
      void                      *arg
    )
    {
      for each IDE Controller chip configured in IDE_Controller_Table
        if (BSP dependent probe(if exists) AND device probe for this IDE chip
            indicates it is present)
          perform initialization of the particular chip
          register device with configured name for this chip
    }

Read IDE Controller Register
============================

The ``ide_controller_read_register`` routine reads the content of the IDE
Controller chip register. IDE Controller chip is selected via the minor
number. This routine is not allowed to be called from an application.

.. code-block:: c

    void ide_controller_read_register(
      rtems_device_minor_number  minor,
      unsigned32                 reg,
      unsigned32                *value
    )
    {
      get IDE Controller chip configuration information from
      IDE_Controller_Table by minor number

      invoke read register routine for the chip
    }

Write IDE Controller Register
=============================

The ``ide_controller_write_register`` routine writes IDE Controller chip
register with specified value. IDE Controller chip is selected via the minor
number. This routine is not allowed to be called from an application.

.. code-block:: c

    void ide_controller_write_register(
      rtems_device_minor_number minor,
      unsigned32                reg,
      unsigned32                value
    )
    {
      get IDE Controller chip configuration information from
      IDE_Controller_Table by minor number

      invoke write register routine for the chip
    }

Read Data Block Through IDE Controller Data Register
====================================================

The ``ide_controller_read_data_block`` provides multiple consequent read of the
IDE Controller Data Register. IDE Controller chip is selected via the minor
number. The same functionality may be achieved via separate multiple calls of
``ide_controller_read_register`` routine but ``ide_controller_read_data_block``
allows to escape functions call overhead. This routine is not allowed to be
called from an application.

.. code-block:: c

    void ide_controller_read_data_block(
      rtems_device_minor_number  minor,
      unsigned16                 block_size,
      blkdev_sg_buffer          *bufs,
      uint32_t                  *cbuf,
      uint32_t                  *pos
    )
    {
      get IDE Controller chip configuration information from
      IDE_Controller_Table by minor number

      invoke read data block routine for the chip
    }

Write Data Block Through IDE Controller Data Register
=====================================================

The ``ide_controller_write_data_block`` provides multiple consequent write into
the IDE Controller Data Register. IDE Controller chip is selected via the minor
number. The same functionality may be achieved via separate multiple calls of
``ide_controller_write_register`` routine but
``ide_controller_write_data_block`` allows to escape functions call
overhead. This routine is not allowed to be called from an application.

.. code-block:: c

    void ide_controller_write_data_block(
      rtems_device_minor_number  minor,
      unsigned16                 block_size,
      blkdev_sg_buffer          *bufs,
      uint32_t                  *cbuf,
      uint32_t                  *pos
    )
    {
      get IDE Controller chip configuration information from
      IDE_Controller_Table by minor number

      invoke write data block routine for the chip
    }
