Thread Manager
##############

Introduction
============

The thread manager implements the functionality required of the thread manager
as defined by POSIX 1003.1b. This standard requires that a compliant operating
system provide the facilties to manage multiple threads of control and defines
the API that must be provided.

The services provided by the thread manager are:

Background
==========

Thread Attributes
-----------------

Thread attributes are utilized only at thread creation time. A thread attribute
structure may be initialized and passed as an argument to the
``pthread_create`` routine.

*stack address*
    is the address of the optionally user specified stack area for this thread.
    If this value is NULL, then RTEMS allocates the memory for the thread stack
    from the RTEMS Workspace Area. Otherwise, this is the user specified
    address for the memory to be used for the thread's stack. Each thread must
    have a distinct stack area. Each processor family has different alignment
    rules which should be followed.

*stack size*
    is the minimum desired size for this thread's stack area.  If the size of
    this area as specified by the stack size attribute is smaller than the
    minimum for this processor family and the stack is not user specified, then
    RTEMS will automatically allocate a stack of the minimum size for this
    processor family.

*contention scope*
    specifies the scheduling contention scope. RTEMS only supports the
    PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS scheduling contention scope.

*scheduling inheritance*
    specifies whether a user specified or the scheduling policy and parameters
    of the currently executing thread are to be used. When this is
    PTHREAD_INHERIT_SCHED, then the scheduling policy and parameters of the
    currently executing thread are inherited by the newly created thread.

*scheduling policy and parameters*
    specify the manner in which the thread will contend for the processor.  The
    scheduling parameters are interpreted based on the specified policy.  All
    policies utilize the thread priority parameter.

Services
========

This section details the thread manager's services.  A subsection is dedicated
to each of this manager's services and describes the calling sequence, related
constants, usage, and status codes.

.. _pthread_attr_init:

pthread_attr_init - Initialize a Thread Attribute Set
-----------------------------------------------------

 :class: rtems-table

 * - ``EINVAL``
   - The attribute pointer argument is invalid.

**DESCRIPTION:**

The ``pthread_attr_init`` routine initializes the thread attributes object
specified by ``attr`` with the default value for all of the individual
attributes.

**NOTES:**

The settings in the default attributes are implementation defined. For RTEMS,
the default attributes are as follows:

   - is not set to indicate that RTEMS is to allocate the stack memory.
 * - *stacksize*
   - is set to ``PTHREAD_MINIMUM_STACK_SIZE``.
 * - *contentionscope*
   - is set to ``PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS``.
 * - *inheritsched*
   - is set to ``PTHREAD_INHERIT_SCHED`` to indicate that the created thread
     inherits its scheduling attributes from its parent.
 * - detachstate
   - is set to ``PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE``.

by ``inheritsched``.

The ``contentionscope`` must be either ``PTHREAD_INHERIT_SCHED`` to indicate
that the thread is to inherit the scheduling policy and parameters fromthe
creating thread, or ``PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED`` to indicate that the scheduling
policy and parameters for this thread are to be set from the corresponding
values in the attributes object.  If ``contentionscope`` is
``PTHREAD_INHERIT_SCHED``, then the scheduling attributes in the ``attr``
structure will be ignored at thread creation time.

        pthread_t             *thread,
        const pthread_attr_t  *attr,
        void                 (*start_routine)( void *),
        void                  *arg
    );

**STATUS CODES:**

.. list-table::
 :class: rtems-table

 * - ``EINVAL``
   - The attribute set is not initialized.
 * - ``EINVAL``
   - The user specified a stack address and the size of the area was not large
     enough to meet this processor's minimum stack requirements.
 * - ``EINVAL``
   - The specified scheduler inheritance policy was invalid.
 * - ``ENOTSUP``
   - The specified contention scope was ``PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS``.
 * - ``EINVAL``
   - The specified thread priority was invalid.
 * - ``EINVAL``
   - The specified scheduling policy was invalid.
 * - ``EINVAL``
   - The scheduling policy was ``SCHED_SPORADIC`` and the specified
     replenishment period is less than the initial budget.
 * - ``EINVAL``
   - The scheduling policy was ``SCHED_SPORADIC`` and the specified low
     priority is invalid.
 * - ``EAGAIN``
   - The system lacked the necessary resources to create another thread, or the
     self imposed limit on the total number of threads in a process
     ``PTHREAD_THREAD_MAX`` would be exceeded.
 * - ``EINVAL``
   - Invalid argument passed.

**DESCRIPTION:**

The ``pthread_create`` routine is used to create a new thread with the
attributes specified by ``attr``. If the ``attr`` argument is ``NULL``, then
the default attribute set will be used. Modification of the contents of
``attr`` after this thread is created does not have an impact on this thread.

The thread begins execution at the address specified by ``start_routine`` with
``arg`` as its only argument. If ``start_routine`` returns, then it is
functionally equivalent to the thread executing the ``pthread_exit`` service.

Upon successful completion, the ID of the created thread is returned in the
``thread`` argument.

**NOTES:**

There is no concept of a single main thread in RTEMS as there is in a tradition
UNIX system. POSIX requires that the implicit return of the main thread results
in the same effects as if there were a call to ``exit``. This does not occur in
RTEMS.

The signal mask of the newly created thread is inherited from its creator and
the set of pending signals for this thread is empty.

.. _pthread_exit:

pthread_exit - Terminate the Current Thread
-------------------------------------------
.. index:: pthread_exit
.. index:: terminate the current thread

**CALLING SEQUENCE:**

.. code-block:: c

    #include <pthread.h>
    void pthread_exit(
        void *status
    );

**STATUS CODES:**

*NONE*

**DESCRIPTION:**

The ``pthread_exit`` routine is used to terminate the calling thread.  The
``status`` is made available to any successful join with the terminating
thread.

When a thread returns from its start routine, it results in an implicit call to
the ``pthread_exit`` routine with the return value of the function serving as
the argument to ``pthread_exit``.

**NOTES:**

Any cancellation cleanup handlers that hace been pushed and not yet popped
shall be popped in reverse of the order that they were pushed. After all
cancellation cleanup handlers have been executed, if the thread has any
thread-specific data, destructors for that data will be invoked.

Thread termination does not release or free any application visible resources
including byt not limited to mutexes, file descriptors, allocated memory,
etc.. Similarly, exitting a thread does not result in any process-oriented
cleanup activity.

There is no concept of a single main thread in RTEMS as there is in a tradition
UNIX system. POSIX requires that the implicit return of the main thread results
in the same effects as if there were a call to ``exit``. This does not occur in
RTEMS.

All access to any automatic variables allocated by the threads is lost when the
thread exits. Thus references (i.e. pointers) to local variables of a thread
should not be used in a global manner without care. As a specific example, a
pointer to a local variable should NOT be used as the return value.

.. _pthread_detach:

pthread_detach - Detach a Thread
--------------------------------
.. index:: pthread_detach
.. index:: detach a thread

**CALLING SEQUENCE:**

.. code-block:: c

    #include <pthread.h>
    int pthread_detach(
        pthread_t thread
    );

**STATUS CODES:**

.. list-table::
 :class: rtems-table

 * - ``ESRCH``
   - The thread specified is invalid.
 * - ``EINVAL``
   - The thread specified is not a joinable thread.

**DESCRIPTION:**

The ``pthread_detach`` routine is used to to indicate that storage for
``thread`` can be reclaimed when the thread terminates without another thread
joinging with it.

**NOTES:**

If any threads have previously joined with the specified thread, then they will
remain joined with that thread. Any subsequent calls to ``pthread_join`` on the
specified thread will fail.

.. COMMENT: pthread_getconcurrency

.. _pthread_getconcurrency:

pthread_getconcurrency - Obtain Thread Concurrency
--------------------------------------------------
.. index:: pthread_getconcurrency
.. index:: obtain thread concurrency

**CALLING SEQUENCE:**

.. code-block:: c

    #include <pthread.h>
    int pthread_getconcurrency(void);

**STATUS CODES:**

This method returns the current concurrency mapping value.

**DESCRIPTION:**

The ``pthread_getconcurrency`` method returns the number of user threads
mapped onto kernel threads. For RTEMS, user and kernel threads are mapped
1:1 and per the POSIX standard this method returns 1 initially and 
the value last set by ``pthread_setconcurrency`` otherwise.

**NOTES:**

NONE

.. COMMENT: pthread_setconcurrency

.. _pthread_setconcurrency:

pthread_setconcurrency - Set Thread Concurrency
-----------------------------------------------
.. index:: pthread_setconcurrency
.. index:: obtain thread concurrency

**CALLING SEQUENCE:**

.. code-block:: c

    #include <pthread.h>
    int pthread_setconcurrency(void);

**STATUS CODES:**

This method returns 0 on success.

**DESCRIPTION:**

The ``pthread_setconcurrency`` method requests the number of user threads
mapped onto kernel threads. Per the POSIX standard, this is considered
a request and may have no impact.

For RTEMS, user and kernel threads are always mapped 1:1 and thus this
method has no change on the mapping. However, ``pthread_getconcurrency``
will return the value set.

**NOTES:**

NONE

.. COMMENT: pthread_getattr_np

.. _pthread_getattr_np:

pthread_getattr_np - Get Thread Attributes
------------------------------------------
.. index:: pthread_getattr_np
.. index:: get thread attributes

**CALLING SEQUENCE:**

.. code-block:: c

    #define _GNU_SOURCE
    #include <pthread.h>
    int pthread_getattr_np(
        pthread_t       thread,
        pthread_attr_t *attr
    );

**STATUS CODES:**

.. list-table::
 :class: rtems-table

 * - ``ESRCH``
   - The thread specified is invalid.
 * - ``EINVAL``
   - The attribute pointer argument is invalid.

**DESCRIPTION:**

The ``pthread_getattr_np`` routine is used to obtain the attributes associated
with ``thread``.

**NOTES:**

Modification of the execution modes and priority through the Classic API may
result in a combination that is not representable in the POSIX API.

.. _pthread_join:

pthread_join - Wait for Thread Termination
------------------------------------------
.. index:: pthread_join
.. index:: wait for thread termination

**CALLING SEQUENCE:**

.. code-block:: c

    #include <pthread.h>
    int pthread_join(
        pthread_t    thread,
        void       **value_ptr
    );

**STATUS CODES:**

.. list-table::
 :class: rtems-table

 * - ``ESRCH``
   - The thread specified is invalid.
 * - ``EINVAL``
   - The thread specified is not a joinable thread.
 * - ``EDEADLK``
   - A deadlock was detected or thread is the calling thread.

**DESCRIPTION:**

The ``pthread_join`` routine suspends execution of the calling thread until
``thread`` terminates. If ``thread`` has already terminated, then this routine
returns immediately. The value returned by ``thread`` (i.e. passed to
``pthread_exit`` is returned in ``value_ptr``.

When this routine returns, then ``thread`` has been terminated.

**NOTES:**

The results of multiple simultaneous joins on the same thread is undefined.

If any threads have previously joined with the specified thread, then they will
remain joined with that thread. Any subsequent calls to ``pthread_join`` on the
specified thread will fail.

If value_ptr is NULL, then no value is returned.

.. _pthread_self:

pthread_self - Get Thread ID
----------------------------
.. index:: pthread_self
.. index:: get thread id

**CALLING SEQUENCE:**

.. code-block:: c

    #include <pthread.h>
    pthread_t pthread_self( void );

**STATUS CODES:**

The value returned is the ID of the calling thread.

**DESCRIPTION:**

This routine returns the ID of the calling thread.

**NOTES:**

NONE

.. _pthread_equal:

pthread_equal - Compare Thread IDs
----------------------------------
.. index:: pthread_equal
.. index:: compare thread ids

**CALLING SEQUENCE:**

.. code-block:: c

    #include <pthread.h>
    int pthread_equal(
        pthread_t t1,
        pthread_t t2
    );

**STATUS CODES:**

.. list-table::
 :class: rtems-table

 * - ``zero``
   - The thread ids are not equal.
 * - ``non-zero``
   - The thread ids are equal.

**DESCRIPTION:**

The ``pthread_equal`` routine is used to compare two thread IDs and determine
if they are equal.

**NOTES:**

The behavior is undefined if the thread IDs are not valid.

.. _pthread_once:

pthread_once - Dynamic Package Initialization
---------------------------------------------
.. index:: pthread_once
.. index:: dynamic package initialization

**CALLING SEQUENCE:**

.. code-block:: c

    #include <pthread.h>
    pthread_once_t once_control = PTHREAD_ONCE_INIT;
    int pthread_once(
        pthread_once_t   *once_control,
        void            (*init_routine)(void)
    );

**STATUS CODES:**

NONE

**DESCRIPTION:**

The ``pthread_once`` routine is used to provide controlled initialization of
variables. The first call to ``pthread_once`` by any thread with the same
``once_control`` will result in the ``init_routine`` being invoked with no
arguments. Subsequent calls to ``pthread_once`` with the same ``once_control``
will have no effect.

The ``init_routine`` is guaranteed to have run to completion when this routine
returns to the caller.

**NOTES:**

The behavior of ``pthread_once`` is undefined if ``once_control`` is automatic
storage (i.e. on a task stack) or is not initialized using
``PTHREAD_ONCE_INIT``.

.. _pthread_setschedparam:

pthread_setschedparam - Set Thread Scheduling Parameters
--------------------------------------------------------
.. index:: pthread_setschedparam
.. index:: set thread scheduling parameters

**CALLING SEQUENCE:**

.. code-block:: c

    #include <pthread.h>
    int pthread_setschedparam(
        pthread_t           thread,
        int                 policy,
        struct sched_param *param
    );

**STATUS CODES:**

.. list-table::
 :class: rtems-table

 * - ``EINVAL``
   - The scheduling parameters indicated by the parameter param is invalid.
 * - ``EINVAL``
   - The value specified by policy is invalid.
 * - ``EINVAL``
   - The scheduling policy was ``SCHED_SPORADIC`` and the specified
     replenishment period is less than the initial budget.
 * - ``EINVAL``
   - The scheduling policy was ``SCHED_SPORADIC`` and the specified low
     priority is invalid.
 * - ``ESRCH``
   - The thread indicated was invalid.

**DESCRIPTION:**

The ``pthread_setschedparam`` routine is used to set the scheduler parameters
currently associated with the thread specified by ``thread`` to the policy
specified by ``policy``. The contents of ``param`` are interpreted based upon
the ``policy`` argument.

**NOTES:**

As required by POSIX, RTEMS defines the feature symbol
``_POSIX_THREAD_PRIORITY_SCHEDULING`` to indicate that the family of routines
to which this routine belongs is supported.

.. _pthread_getschedparam:

pthread_getschedparam - Get Thread Scheduling Parameters
--------------------------------------------------------
.. index:: pthread_getschedparam
.. index:: get thread scheduling parameters

**CALLING SEQUENCE:**

.. code-block:: c

    #include <pthread.h>
    int pthread_getschedparam(
        pthread_t           thread,
        int                *policy,
        struct sched_param *param
    );

**STATUS CODES:**

.. list-table::
 :class: rtems-table

 * - ``EINVAL``
   - The policy pointer argument is invalid.
 * - ``EINVAL``
   - The scheduling parameters pointer argument is invalid.
 * - ``ESRCH``
   - The thread indicated by the parameter thread is invalid.

**DESCRIPTION:**

The ``pthread_getschedparam`` routine is used to obtain the scheduler policy
and parameters associated with ``thread``.  The current policy and associated
parameters values returned in``policy`` and ``param``, respectively.

**NOTES:**

As required by POSIX, RTEMS defines the feature symbol
``_POSIX_THREAD_PRIORITY_SCHEDULING`` to indicate that the family of routines
to which this routine belongs is supported.
