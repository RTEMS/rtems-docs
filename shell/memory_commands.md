Memory Commands
***************

Introduction
============

The RTEMS shell has the following memory commands:

- mdump_ - Display contents of memory

- wdump_ - Display contents of memory (word)

- ldump_ - Display contents of memory (longword)

- medit_ - Modify contents of memory

- mfill_ - File memory with pattern

- mmove_ - Move contents of memory

- malloc_ - Obtain information on C Program Heap

Commands
========

This section details the Memory Commands available.  A
subsection is dedicated to each of the commands and
describes the behavior and configuration of that
command as well as providing an example usage.

.. _mdump:

mdump - display contents of memory
----------------------------------
.. index:: mdump

SYNOPSYS:
    .. code-block:: shell

        mdump [address [length [size]]]

DESCRIPTION:
    This command displays the contents of memory at the ``address`` and
    ``length`` in ``size`` byte units specified on the command line.

    When ``size`` is not provided, it defaults to ``1`` byte units.  Values of
    ``1``, ``2``, and ``4`` are valid; all others will cause an error to be
    reported.

    When ``length`` is not provided, it defaults to ``320`` which is twenty
    lines of output with sixteen bytes of output per line.

    When ``address`` is not provided, it defaults to ``0x00000000``.

EXIT STATUS:
    This command always returns 0 to indicate success.

NOTES:
    Dumping memory from a non-existent address may result in an unrecoverable
    program fault.

EXAMPLES:
    The following is an example of how to use ``mdump``:

    .. code-block:: shell

        SHLL [/] $ mdump 0x10000 32
        0x0001000000 00 00 00 00 00 00 00-00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ................

CONFIGURATION:
    This command is included in the default shell command set.  When building a
    custom command set, define ``CONFIGURE_SHELL_COMMAND_MDUMP`` to have this
    command included.

    This command can be excluded from the shell command set by defining
    ``CONFIGURE_SHELL_NO_COMMAND_MDUMP`` when all shell commands have been

.. index:: rtems_shell_rtems_main_mdump

PROGRAMMING INFORMATION:
    The ``mdump`` is implemented by a C language function which has the
    following prototype:

    .. code-block:: c

        int rtems_shell_rtems_main_mdump(
            int    argc,
            char **argv

.. _wdump:

wdump - display contents of memory (word)
-----------------------------------------
.. index:: wdump

SYNOPSYS:
    .. code-block:: shell

        wdump [address [length]]

DESCRIPTION:
    This command displays the contents of memory at the ``address`` and
    ``length`` in bytes specified on the command line.

    This command is equivalent to ``mdump address length 2``.

    When ``length`` is not provided, it defaults to ``320`` which is twenty
    lines of output with eight words of output per line.

    When ``address`` is not provided, it defaults to ``0x00000000``.

EXIT STATUS:
    This command always returns 0 to indicate success.

NOTES:
    Dumping memory from a non-existent address may result in an unrecoverable
    program fault.

PROGRAMMING INFORMATION:
    The ``medit`` is implemented by a C language function which has the
    following prototype:

    .. code-block:: c

        int rtems_shell_rtems_main_medit(
            int    argc,

.. _mfill:

mfill - file memory with pattern
--------------------------------
.. index:: mfill

SYNOPSYS:
    .. code-block:: shell

        mfill address length value

DESCRIPTION:
    This command is used to fill the memory starting at ``address`` for the
    specified ``length`` in octets when the specified at``value``.

EXIT STATUS:
    This command returns 0 on success and non-zero if an error is encountered.

NOTES:
    Filling a non-existent address range may result in an unrecoverable program
    fault.  Similarly overwriting interrupt vector tables, code space or
    critical data areas can be fatal as shown in the example.

EXAMPLES:
    In this example, the address used (``0x23d89a0``) as the base address of
    the filled area is the end of the stack for the Idle thread.  This address
    was determined manually using gdb and is very specific to this application
    and BSP.  The first command in this example is an ``mdump`` to display the
    initial contents of this memory.  We see that the first 8 bytes are 0xA5
    which is the pattern used as a guard by the Stack Checker.  On the first
    context switch after the pattern is overwritten by the ``mfill`` command,
    the Stack Checker detect the pattern has been corrupted and generates a
    fatal error.

    .. code-block:: shell

        SHLL [/] $ mdump 0x23d89a0 16
        0x023D89A0 A5 A5 A5 A5 A5 A5 A5 A5-FE ED F0 0D 0B AD 0D 06 ................
        SHLL [/] $ mfill 0x23d89a0 13 0x5a
        SHLL [/] $ BLOWN STACK!!! Offending task(0x23D4418): id=0x09010001; name=0x0203D908
        stack covers range 0x23D89A0 - 0x23D99AF (4112 bytes)
        Damaged pattern begins at 0x023D89A8 and is 16 bytes long
