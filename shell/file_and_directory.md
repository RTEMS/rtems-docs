.. _blksync:

blksync - sync the block driver
-------------------------------
.. index:: blksync

SYNOPSYS:
    .. code-block:: shell

        blksync driver

DESCRIPTION:
    This command issues a block driver sync call to the driver. The driver is a
    path to a device node. The sync call will flush all pending writes in the
    cache to the media and block until the writes have completed.

EXIT STATUS:
    This command returns 0 on success and non-zero if an error is encountered.

NOTES:
    None.

EXAMPLES:
    The following is an example of how to use ``blksync``:

    .. code-block:: shell

        blksync /dev/hda1

.. index:: CONFIGURE_SHELL_NO_COMMAND_BLKSYNC
.. index:: CONFIGURE_SHELL_COMMAND_BLKSYNC

CONFIGURATION:
    This command is included in the default shell command set.  When building a
    custom command set, define ``CONFIGURE_SHELL_COMMAND_BLKSYNC`` to have this
    command included.

    This command can be excluded from the shell command set by defining
    ``CONFIGURE_SHELL_NO_COMMAND_BLKSYNC`` when all shell commands have been
    configured.

.. index:: rtems_shell_rtems_main_blksync

PROGRAMMING INFORMATION:
    The ``blksync`` is implemented by a C language function which has the
    following prototype:

CONFIGURATION:
    This command is included in the default shell command set.  When building a
    custom command set, define ``CONFIGURE_SHELL_COMMAND_CHROOT`` to have this
    command included. Additional to that you have to add one POSIX key value
    pair for each thread where you want to use the command.

    This command can be excluded from the shell command set by defining
    ``CONFIGURE_SHELL_NO_COMMAND_CHROOT`` when all shell commands have been
    configured.

.. index:: rtems_shell_rtems_main_chroot

PROGRAMMING INFORMATION:
    The ``chroot`` is implemented by a C language function which has the
    following prototype:

    .. code-block:: c

        int rtems_shell_rtems_main_chroot(
            int    argc,
            char **argv
        );

    .. code-block:: c

        extern rtems_shell_cmd_t rtems_shell_CHROOT_Command;

.. raw:: latex

   \clearpage

.. _cp:

cp - copy files
---------------
.. index:: cp

SYNOPSYS:
    .. code-block:: shell

        cp [-R [-H | -L | -P]] [-f | -i] [-pv] src target
        cp [-R [-H | -L] ] [-f | -i] [-NpPv] source_file ... target_directory

DESCRIPTION:
    In the first synopsis form, the cp utility copies the contents of the
    source_file to the target_file. In the second synopsis form, the contents
    of each named source_file is copied to the destination
    target_directory. The names of the files themselves are not changed. If cp
    detects an attempt to copy a file to itself, the copy will fail.

    The following options are available:

    *-f*
        For each existing destination pathname, attempt to overwrite it. If
        permissions do not allow copy to succeed, remove it and create a new
        file, without prompting for confirmation. (The -i option is ignored if
        the -f option is specified.)

    *-H*
        If the -R option is specified, symbolic links on the command line are
        followed.  (Symbolic links encountered in the tree traversal are not
        followed.)

    *-i*
        Causes cp to write a prompt to the standard error output before copying
        a file that would overwrite an existing file. If the response from the
        standard input begins with the character 'y', the file copy is
        attempted.

    *-L*
        If the -R option is specified, all symbolic links are followed.

    *-N*
        When used with -p, do not copy file flags.

    *-P*
        No symbolic links are followed.

    *-p*
        Causes cp to preserve in the copy as many of the modification time,
        access time, file flags, file mode, user ID, and group ID as allowed by
        permissions.  If the user ID and group ID cannot be preserved, no error
        message is displayed and the exit value is not altered.  If the source
        file has its set user ID bit on and the user ID cannot be preserved,
        the set user ID bit is not preserved in the copy's permissions. If the
        source file has its set group ID bit on and the group ID cannot be
        preserved, the set group ID bit is not preserved in the copy's
        permissions. If the source file has both its set user ID and set group
        ID bits on, and either the user ID or group ID cannot be preserved,
        neither the set user ID or set group ID bits are preserved in the
        copy's permissions.

    *-R*
        If source_file designates a directory, cp copies the directory and the
        entire subtree connected at that point. This option also causes
        symbolic links to be copied, rather than indirected through, and for cp
        to create special files rather than copying them as normal
        files. Created directories have the same mode as the corresponding
        source directory, unmodified by the process's umask.

    *-v*
        Cause cp to be verbose, showing files as they are copied.

    For each destination file that already exists, its contents are overwritten
    if permissions allow, but its mode, user ID, and group ID are unchanged.

    In the second synopsis form, target_directory must exist unless there is
    only one named source_file which is a directory and the -R flag is
    specified.

    If the destination file does not exist, the mode of the source file is used
    as modified by the file mode creation mask (umask, see csh(1)). If the
    source file has its set user ID bit on, that bit is removed unless both the
    source file and the destination file are owned by the same user. If the
    source file has its set group ID bit on, that bit is removed unless both
    the source file and the destination file are in the same group and the user
    is a member of that group.  If both the set user ID and set group ID bits
    are set, all of the above conditions must be fulfilled or both bits are
    removed.

    Appropriate permissions are required for file creation or overwriting.

    Symbolic links are always followed unless the -R flag is set, in which case
    symbolic links are not followed, by default. The -H or -L flags (in
    conjunction with the -R flag), as well as the -P flag cause symbolic links
    to be followed as described above. The -H and -L options are ignored unless
    the -R option is specified. In addition, these options override
    eachsubhedading other and the command's actions are determined by the last
    one specified.

EXIT STATUS:
    This command returns 0 on success and non-zero if an error is encountered.

NOTES:
    NONE

EXAMPLES:
    The following is an example of how to use ``cp`` to copy a file to a new
    name in the current directory:

    .. code-block:: shell

        SHLL [/] # cat joel
        cat: joel: No such file or directory
        SHLL [/] # cp etc/passwd joel
        SHLL [/] # cat joel
        root:*:0:0:root::/:/bin/sh
        rtems:*:1:1:RTEMS Application::/:/bin/sh
        tty:!:2:2:tty owner::/:/bin/false
        SHLL [/] # ls
        drwxr-xr-x   1   root   root         536 Jan 01 00:00 dev/
        drwxr-xr-x   1   root   root        1072 Jan 01 00:00 etc/
        -rw-r--r--   1   root   root         102 Jan 01 00:00 joel
        3 files 1710 bytes occupied

    The following is an example of how to use ``cp`` to copy one or more files
    to a destination directory and use the same ``basename`` in the destination
    directory:

    .. code-block:: shell

        SHLL [/] # mkdir tmp
        SHLL [/] # ls tmp
        0 files 0 bytes occupied
        SHLL [/] # cp /etc/passwd tmp
        SHLL [/] # ls /tmp
        -rw-r--r--   1   root   root         102 Jan 01 00:01 passwd
        1 files 102 bytes occupied
        SHLL [/] # cp /etc/passwd /etc/group /tmp
        SHLL [/] # ls /tmp

.. _dd:

dd - convert and copy a file
----------------------------
.. index:: dd

SYNOPSYS:
    .. code-block:: shell

        dd [operands ...]

DESCRIPTION:
    The dd utility copies the standard input to the standard output.  Input
    data is read and written in 512-byte blocks.  If input reads are short,
    input from multiple reads are aggregated to form the output block.  When
    finished, dd displays the number of complete and partial input and output
    blocks and truncated input records to the standard error output.

    The following operands are available:

    *bs=n*
        Set both input and output block size, superseding the ibs and obs
        operands.  If no conversion values other than noerror, notrunc or sync
        are specified, then each input block is copied to the output as a
        single block without any aggregation of short blocks.

    *cbs=n*
        Set the conversion record size to n bytes.  The conversion record size
        is required by the record oriented conversion values.

    *count=n*
        Copy only n input blocks.

    *files=n*
        Copy n input files before terminating.  This operand is only applicable
        when the input device is a tape.

    *ibs=n*
        Set the input block size to n bytes instead of the default 512.

    *if=file*
        Read input from file instead of the standard input.

    *obs=n*
        Set the output block size to n bytes instead of the default 512.

    *of=file*
        Write output to file instead of the standard output.  Any regular
        output file is truncated unless the notrunc conversion value is
        specified.  If an initial portion of the output file is skipped (see
        the seek operand) the output file is truncated at that point.

    *seek=n*
        Seek n blocks from the beginning of the output before copying.  On
        non-tape devices, a *lseek* operation is used.  Otherwise, existing
        blocks are read and the data discarded.  If the seek operation is past
        the end of file, space from the current end of file to the specified
        offset is filled with blocks of NUL bytes.

    *skip=n*
        Skip n blocks from the beginning of the input before copying.  On input
        which supports seeks, a *lseek* operation is used.  Otherwise, input
        data is read and discarded.  For pipes, the correct number of bytes is
        read.  For all other devices, the correct number of blocks is read
        without distinguishing between a partial or complete block being read.

    *progress=n*
        Switch on display of progress if n is set to any non-zero value.  This
        will cause a "." to be printed (to the standard error output) for every
        n full or partial blocks written to the output file.

    *conv=value[,value...]*
        Where value is one of the symbols from the following list.

        *ascii, oldascii*
            The same as the unblock value except that characters are translated
            from EBCDIC to ASCII before the records are converted.  (These
            values imply unblock if the operand cbs is also specified.)  There
            are two conversion maps for ASCII.  The value ascii specifies the
            recom- mended one which is compatible with AT&T System V UNIX.  The
            value oldascii specifies the one used in historic AT&T and pre
            4.3BSD-Reno systems.

        *block*
            Treats the input as a sequence of newline or end-of-file terminated
            variable length records independent of input and output block
            boundaries.  Any trailing newline character is discarded.  Each
            input record is converted to a fixed length output record where the
            length is specified by the cbs operand.  Input records shorter than
            the conversion record size are padded with spaces.  Input records
            longer than the conversion record size are truncated.  The number
            of truncated input records, if any, are reported to the standard
            error output at the completion of the copy.

        *ebcdic, ibm, oldebcdic, oldibm*
            The same as the block value except that characters are translated
            from ASCII to EBCDIC after the records are converted.  (These
            values imply block if the operand cbs is also specified.)  There
            are four conversion maps for EBCDIC.  The value ebcdic specifies
            the recommended one which is compatible with AT&T System V UNIX.
            The value ibm is a slightly different mapping, which is compatible
            with the AT&T System V UNIX ibm value.  The values oldebcdic and
            oldibm are maps used in historic AT&T and pre 4.3BSD-Reno systems.

        *lcase*
            Transform uppercase characters into lowercase characters.

        *noerror*
            Do not stop processing on an input error.  When an input error
            occurs, a diagnostic message followed by the current input and
            output block counts will be written to the standard error output in
            the same format as the standard completion message.  If the sync
            conversion is also specified, any missing input data will be
            replaced with NUL bytes (or with spaces if a block oriented
            conversion value was specified) and processed as a normal input
            buffer.  If the sync conversion is not specified, the input block
            is omitted from the output.  On input files which are not tapes or
            pipes, the file offset will be positioned past the block in which
            the error occurred using lseek(2).

        *notrunc*
            Do not truncate the output file.  This will preserve any blocks in
            the output file not explicitly written by dd.  The notrunc value is
            not supported for tapes.

        *osync*
            Pad the final output block to the full output block size.  If the
            input file is not a multiple of the output block size after
            conversion, this conversion forces the final output block to be the
            same size as preceding blocks for use on devices that require
            regularly sized blocks to be written.  This option is incompatible
            with use of the bs=n block size specification.

        *sparse*
            If one or more non-final output blocks would consist solely of NUL
            bytes, try to seek the output file by the required space instead of
            filling them with NULs.  This results in a sparse file on some file
            systems.

        *swab*
            Swap every pair of input bytes.  If an input buffer has an odd
            number of bytes, the last byte will be ignored during swapping.

        *sync*
            Pad every input block to the input buffer size.  Spaces are used
            for pad bytes if a block oriented conversion value is specified,
            otherwise NUL bytes are used.

        *ucase*
            Transform lowercase characters into uppercase characters.

        *unblock*
            Treats the input as a sequence of fixed length records independent
            of input and output block boundaries.  The length of the input
            records is specified by the cbs operand.  Any trailing space
            characters are discarded and a newline character is appended.

    Where sizes are specified, a decimal number of bytes is expected.  Two or
    more numbers may be separated by an "x" to indicate a product.  Each number
    may have one of the following optional suffixes:

    *b*
        Block; multiply by 512

    *k*
        Kibi; multiply by 1024 (1 KiB)

    *m*
        Mebi; multiply by 1048576 (1 MiB)

    *g*
        Gibi; multiply by 1073741824 (1 GiB)

    *t*
        Tebi; multiply by 1099511627776 (1 TiB)

    *w*
        Word; multiply by the number of bytes in an integer

    When finished, dd displays the number of complete and partial input and
    output blocks, truncated input records and odd-length byte-swapping ritten.
    Partial output blocks to tape devices are considered fatal errors.
    Otherwise, the rest of the block will be written.  Partial output blocks to
    character devices will produce a warning message.  A truncated input block
    is one where a variable length record oriented conversion value was
    specified and the input line was too long to fit in the conversion record
    or was not newline terminated.

    Normally, data resulting from input or conversion or both are aggregated
    into output blocks of the specified size.  After the end of input is
    reached, any remaining output is written as a block.  This means that the
    final output block may be shorter than the output block size.

SYNOPSYS:
    .. code-block:: shell

        hexdump [-bcCdovx] [-e format_string] [-f format_file] [-n length] [-s skip] file ...

DESCRIPTION:
    The hexdump utility is a filter which displays the specified files, or the
    standard input, if no files are specified, in a user specified format.

    The options are as follows:

    *-b*
        One-byte octal display.  Display the input offset in hexadecimal,
        followed by sixteen space-separated, three column, zero-filled, bytes
        of input data, in octal, per line.

    *-c*
        One-byte character display.  Display the input offset in hexadecimal,
        followed by sixteen space-separated, three column, space-filled,
        characters of input data per line.

    *-C*
        Canonical hex+ASCII display.  Display the input offset in hexadecimal,
        followed by sixteen space-separated, two column, hexadecimal bytes,
        followed by the same sixteen bytes in %_p format enclosed in "|"
        characters.

    *-d*
        Two-byte decimal display.  Display the input offset in hexadecimal,
        followed by eight space-separated, five column, zero-filled, two-byte
        units of input data, in unsigned decimal, per line.

    *-e format_string*
        Specify a format string to be used for displaying data.

    *-f format_file*
        Specify a file that contains one or more newline separated format
        strings.  Empty lines and lines whose first non-blank character is a
        hash mark (#) are ignored.

    *-n length*
        Interpret only length bytes of input.

    *-o*
        Two-byte octal display.  Display the input offset in hexadecimal,
        followed by eight space-separated, six column, zerofilled, two byte
        quantities of input data, in octal, per line.

    *-s offset*
        Skip offset bytes from the beginning of the input.  By default, offset
        is interpreted as a decimal number.  With a leading 0x or 0X, offset is
        interpreted as a hexadecimal number, otherwise, with a leading 0,
        offset is interpreted as an octal number.  Appending the character b,
        k, or m to offset causes it to be interpreted as a multiple of 512,
        1024, or 1048576, respectively.

    *-v*
        The -v option causes hexdump to display all input data.  Without the -v
        option, any number of groups of output lines, which would be identical
        to the immediately preceding group of output lines (except for the
        input offsets), are replaced with a line containing a single asterisk.

    *-x*
        Two-byte hexadecimal display.  Display the input offset in hexadecimal,
        followed by eight, space separated, four column, zero-filled, two-byte
        quantities of input data, in hexadecimal, per line.

    For each input file, hexdump sequentially copies the input to standard
    output, transforming the data according to the format strings specified by
    the -e and -f options, in the order that they were specified.

    *Formats*

    A format string contains any number of format units, separated by
    whitespace.  A format unit contains up to three items: an iteration count,
    a byte count, and a format.

    The iteration count is an optional positive integer, which defaults to one.
    Each format is applied iteration count times.

    The byte count is an optional positive integer.  If specified it defines
    the number of bytes to be interpreted by each iteration of the format.

    If an iteration count and/or a byte count is specified, a single slash must
    be placed after the iteration count and/or before the byte count to
    disambiguate them.  Any whitespace before or after the slash is ignored.

    The format is required and must be surrounded by double quote (" ") marks.
    It is interpreted as a fprintf-style format string (see*fprintf*), with the
    following exceptions:

    - An asterisk (*) may not be used as a field width or precision.

    - A byte count or field precision is required for each "s" con- version
      character (unlike the fprintf(3) default which prints the entire string
      if the precision is unspecified).

    - The conversion characters "h", "l", "n", "p" and "q" are not supported.

    - The single character escape sequences described in the C standard are
      supported:

          NUL                  \0
          <alert character>    \a
          <backspace>          \b
          <form-feed>          \f
          <newline>            \n
          <carriage return>    \r
          <tab>                \t
          <vertical tab>       \v

    Hexdump also supports the following additional conversion strings:

    *_a[dox]*
        Display the input offset, cumulative across input files, of the next
        byte to be displayed.  The appended characters d, o, and x specify the
        display base as decimal, octal or hexadecimal respectively.

    *_A[dox]*
        Identical to the _a conversion string except that it is only performed
        once, when all of the input data has been processed.

    *_c*
        Output characters in the default character set.  Nonprinting characters
        are displayed in three character, zero-padded octal, except for those
        representable by standard escape notation (see above), which are
        displayed as two character strings.

    *_p*
        Output characters in the default character set.  Nonprinting characters
        are displayed as a single ".".

    *_u*
        Output US ASCII characters, with the exception that control characters
        are displayed using the following, lower-case, names.  Characters
        greater than 0xff, hexadecimal, are displayed as hexadecimal strings.

    The default and supported byte counts for the conversion characters are as
    follows:

        +----------------------+---------------------------------+
        |%_c, %_p, %_u, %c     |One byte counts only.            |
        +----------------------+---------------------------------+
        |%d, %i, %o, %u, %X, %x|Four byte default, one, two, four|
        |                      |and eight byte counts supported. |
        +----------------------+---------------------------------+
        |%E, %e, %f, %G, %g    |Eight byte default, four byte    |
        |                      |counts supported.                |
        +----------------------+---------------------------------+

    The amount of data interpreted by each format string is the sum of the data
    required by each format unit, which is the iteration count times the byte
    count, or the iteration count times the number of bytes required by the
    format if the byte count is not specified.

    The input is manipulated in "blocks", where a block is defined as the
    largest amount of data specified by any format string.  Format strings
    interpreting less than an input block's worth of data, whose last format
    unit both interprets some number of bytes and does not have a specified
    iteration count, have the iteration count incremented until the entire
    input block has been processed or there is not enough data remaining in the
    block to satisfy the format string.

    If, either as a result of user specification or hexdump modifying the
    iteration count as described above, an iteration count is greater than one,
    no trailing whitespace characters are output during the last iteration.

    It is an error to specify a byte count as well as multiple conversion
    characters or strings unless all but one of the conversion characters or
    strings is _a or _A.

    If, as a result of the specification of the -n option or end-of-file being
    reached, input data only partially satisfies a format string, the input
    block is zero-padded sufficiently to display all available data (i.e. any
    format units overlapping the end of data will display some num- ber of the
    zero bytes).

    Further output by such format strings is replaced by an equivalent number
    of spaces.  An equivalent number of spaces is defined as the number of
    spaces output by an s conversion character with the same field width and
    precision as the original conversion character or conversion string but
    with any "+", " ", "#" conversion flag characters removed, and ref-
    erencing a NULL string.

    If no format strings are specified, the default display is equivalent to
    specifying the -x option.

ln - make links
---------------

SYNOPSYS:
    .. code-block:: shell

        ln [-fhinsv] source_file [target_file]
        ln [-fhinsv] source_file ... target_dir

DESCRIPTION:
    The ln utility creates a new directory entry (linked file) which has the
    same modes as the original file.  It is useful for maintaining multiple
    copies of a file in many places at once without using up storage for the
    "copies"; instead, a link "points" to the original copy.  There are two
    types of links; hard links and symbolic links.  How a link "points" to a
    file is one of the differences between a hard or symbolic link.

    The options are as follows:

    *-f*
        Unlink any already existing file, permitting the link to occur.

    *-h*
        If the target_file or target_dir is a symbolic link, do not follow it.
        This is most useful with the -f option, to replace a symlink which may
        point to a directory.

    *-i*
        Cause ln to write a prompt to standard error if the target file exists.
        If the response from the standard input begins with the character 'y'
        or 'Y', then unlink the target file so that the link may occur.
        Otherwise, do not attempt the link.  (The -i option overrides any
        previous -f options.)

    *-n*
        Same as -h, for compatibility with other ln implementations.

    *-s*
        Create a symbolic link.

    *-v*
        Cause ln to be verbose, showing files as they are processed.

    By default ln makes hard links.  A hard link to a file is indistinguishable
    from the original directory entry; any changes to a file are effective
    independent of the name used to reference the file.  Hard links may not
    normally refer to directories and may not span file systems.

    A symbolic link contains the name of the file to which it is linked.  The
    referenced file is used when an *open* operation is performed on the link.
    A *stat* on a symbolic link will return the linked-to file; an *lstat* must
    be done to obtain information about the link.  The *readlink* call may be
    used to read the contents of a symbolic link.  Symbolic links may span file
    systems and may refer to directories.

    Given one or two arguments, ln creates a link to an existing file
    source_file.  If target_file is given, the link has that name; target_file
    may also be a directory in which to place the link; otherwise it is placed
    in the current directory.  If only the directory is specified, the link
    will be made to the last component of source_file.

    Given more than two arguments, ln makes links in target_dir to all the
    named source files.  The links made will have the same name as the files
    being linked to.

EXIT STATUS:
    The ``ln`` utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

    None.

        mknod [-rR] [-g gid] [-m mode] [-u uid] name p

DESCRIPTION:
    The mknod command creates device special files, or fifos.  Normally the
    shell script /dev/MAKEDEV is used to create special files for commonly
    known devices; it executes mknod with the appropriate arguments and can
    make all the files required for the device.

    To make nodes manually, the arguments are:

    *-r*
        Replace an existing file if its type is incorrect.

    *-R*
        Replace an existing file if its type is incorrect.  Correct the mode,
        user and group.

    *-g gid*
        Specify the group for the device node.  The gid operand may be a
        numeric group ID or a group name.  If a group name is also a numeric
        group ID, the operand is used as a group name.  Precede a numeric group
        ID with a # to stop it being treated as a name.

    *-m mode*
        Specify the mode for the device node.  The mode may be absolute or
        symbolic, see *chmod*.

    *-u uid*
        Specify the user for the device node.  The uid operand may be a numeric
        user ID or a user name.  If a user name is also a numeric user ID, the
        operand is used as a user name.  Precede a numeric user ID with a # to
        stop it being treated as a name.

    *name*
        Device name, for example "tty" for a termios serial device or "hd" for
        a disk.

    *b | c | p*
        Type of device.  If the device is a block type device such as a tape or
        disk drive which needs both cooked and raw special files, the type
        is b.  All other devices are character type devices, such as terminal
        and pseudo devices, and are type c.  Specifying p creates fifo files.

    *driver | major*
        The major device number is an integer number which tells the kernel
        which device driver entry point to use.  If the device driver is
        configured into the current kernel it may be specified by driver name
        or major number.

    *minor*
        The minor device number tells the kernel which one of several similar
        devices the node corresponds to; for example, it may be a specific
        serial port or pty.

    *unit and subunit*
        The unit and subunit numbers select a subset of a device; for example,
        the unit may specify a particular disk, and the subunit a partition on
        that disk.  (Currently this form of specification is only supported by
        the bsdos format, for compatibility with the BSD/OS mknod).

    *number*
        A single opaque device number.  Useful for netbooted computers which
        require device numbers packed in a format that isn't supported by -F.

EXIT STATUS:
    The ``mknod`` utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

------------------------------
.. index:: mkrfs

SYNOPSYS:
    .. code-block:: shell

        mkrfs [-vsbiIo] device

DESCRIPTION:
    Format the block device with the RTEMS File System (RFS). The default
    configuration with not parameters selects a suitable block size based on
    the size of the media being formatted.

    The media is broken up into groups of blocks. The number of blocks in a
    group is based on the number of bits a block contains. The large a block
    the more blocks a group contains and the fewer groups in the file system.

    The following options are provided:

    *-v*
        Display configuration and progress of the format.

    *-s*
        Set the block size in bytes.

    *-b*
        The number of blocks in a group. The block count must be equal or less
        than the number of bits in a block.

    *-i*
        Number of inodes in a group. The inode count must be equal or less than
        the number of bits in a block.

    *-I*
        Initialise the inodes. The default is not to initialise the inodes and
        to rely on the inode being initialised when allocated. Initialising the
        inode table helps recovery if a problem appears.

    *-o*
        Integer percentage of the media used by inodes. The default is 1%.

    *device*
        Path of the device to format.

    This command returns 0 on success and non-zero if an error is encountered.

    following prototype:

    .. code-block:: c

        int rtems_shell_rtems_main_mkrfs(
            int    argc,
            char **argv
        );

.. _mount:

mount - mount disk
------------------
.. index:: mount

SYNOPSYS:
    .. code-block:: shell

        mount [-t fstype] [-r] [-L] device path

DESCRIPTION:
    The ``mount`` command will mount a block device to a mount point using the
    specified file system. The files systems are:

    - msdos - MSDOS File System

    - tftp  - TFTP Network File System

    - ftp   - FTP Network File System

    - nfs   - Network File System

    - rfs   - RTEMS File System

    When the file system type is 'msdos' or 'rfs' the driver is a "block device
    driver" node present in the file system. The driver is ignored with the
    'tftp' and 'ftp' file systems. For the 'nfs' file system the driver is the
    'host:/path' string that described NFS host and the exported file system
    path.

EXIT STATUS:
    This command returns 0 on success and non-zero if an error is encountered.

NOTES:
    The mount point must exist.

    The services offered by each file-system vary. For example you cannot list
    the directory of a TFTP file-system as this server is not provided in the
    TFTP protocol. You need to check each file-system's documentation for the
    services provided.

EXAMPLES:
    Mount the Flash Disk driver to the '/fd' mount point:

    .. code-block:: shell

        SHLL [/] $ mount -t msdos /dev/flashdisk0 /fd

    Mount the NFS file system exported path 'bar' by host 'foo':

    .. code-block:: shell

        $ mount -t nfs foo:/bar /nfs

    Mount the TFTP file system on '/tftp':

    .. code-block:: shell

        $ mount -t tftp /tftp

    To access the TFTP files on server '10.10.10.10':
    .. code-block:: shell

        $ cat /tftp/10.10.10.10/test.txt

.. index:: CONFIGURE_SHELL_NO_COMMAND_MOUNT

CONFIGURATION:
    This command is included in the default shell command set.  When building a

    command included.

    This command can be excluded from the shell command set by defining
    ``CONFIGURE_SHELL_NO_COMMAND_MOUNT`` when all shell commands have been
    configured.

    The mount command includes references to file-system code. If you do not
    wish to include file-system that you do not use do not define the mount
    command support for that file-system. The file-system mount command defines
    are:

    - msdos - CONFIGURE_SHELL_MOUNT_MSDOS

    - tftp - CONFIGURE_SHELL_MOUNT_TFTP

    - ftp - CONFIGURE_SHELL_MOUNT_FTP

    - nfs - CONFIGURE_SHELL_MOUNT_NFS

    - rfs - CONFIGURE_SHELL_MOUNT_RFS

    An example configuration is:

    .. code-block:: c

        #define CONFIGURE_SHELL_MOUNT_MSDOS
        #ifdef RTEMS_NETWORKING
        #define CONFIGURE_SHELL_MOUNT_TFTP

.. _mv:

mv - move files
---------------
.. index:: mv

SYNOPSYS:
    .. code-block:: shell

        mv [-fiv] source_file target_file
        mv [-fiv] source_file... target_file

DESCRIPTION:
    In its first form, the mv utility renames the file named by the source
    operand to the destination path named by the target operand.  This form is
    assumed when the last operand does not name an already existing directory.

    In its second form, mv moves each file named by a source operand to a
    destination file in the existing directory named by the directory operand.
    The destination path for each operand is the pathname produced by the
    concatenation of the last operand, a slash, and the final pathname
    component of the named file.

    The following options are available:

    *-f*
        Do not prompt for confirmation before overwriting the destination path.

    *-i*
        Causes mv to write a prompt to standard error before moving a file that
        would overwrite an existing file.  If the response from the standard
        input begins with the character 'y', the move is attempted.

    *-v*
        Cause mv to be verbose, showing files as they are processed.

    The last of any -f or -i options is the one which affects mv's behavior.

    It is an error for any of the source operands to specify a nonexistent file
    or directory.

    It is an error for the source operand to specify a directory if the target
    exists and is not a directory.

    If the destination path does not have a mode which permits writing, mv
    prompts the user for confirmation as specified for the -i option.

    Should the *rename* call fail because source and target are on different
    file systems, ``mv`` will remove the destination file, copy the source file
    to the destination, and then remove the source.  The effect is roughly
    equivalent to:

    .. code-block:: shell

        rm -f destination_path && \
        cp -PRp source_file destination_path && \
        rm -rf source_file

EXIT STATUS:
    The ``mv`` utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

NOTES:
    None.
