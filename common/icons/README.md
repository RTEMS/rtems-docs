# Icons

These are the SVG icons we use in GitLab and elsewhere.

To build them you need Inkscape installed if you require PNG icons.

```shell
  ./gen_svg.py
  ./gen_png.py
```

Will build the SVG and PNG files if you need them.

`list.txt` contains the colours and the icon names respectively.

`base.svg` is the base SVG with replaceables to swap the values in.
