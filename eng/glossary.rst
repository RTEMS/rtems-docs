    API
        This term is an acronym for Application Programming Interface.

    assembler language
        The assembler language is a programming language which can be translated very
        easily into machine code and data.  For this project assembler languages are
        restricted to languages accepted by the :term:`GNU` assembler
        program for the target architectures.

    C language
        The C language for this project is defined in terms of
        :term:`C11`.

    C11
        The standard ISO/IEC 9899:2011.

    CCB
        This term is an acronym for Change Control Board.

    concurrent system
        The term refers to a system composed of a number of seperate computations
        running at the "same" time. In practice, each computation is taking turns
        in getting access to one of the available processors. Most 
        :term:`formal semantics` view these as involving :term:`nondeterministic`
        choices regarding when each computation runs on any given processor.

        In the RTEMS context, such a computation could be a :term:`task` or
        :term:`thread`, but could also be a scheduler instance in a SMP setting.

    Doorstop
        `Doorstop <https://github.com/doorstop-dev/doorstop>`_ is a
        requirements management tool.

    EARS
        This term is an acronym for Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax.

    ELF
        This term is an acronym for
        `Executable and Linkable Format <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format>`_.

    formal model
        The term describes a model based on a notation that has a precise
        mathematical :term:`semantics`.

    GCC
        This term is an acronym for `GNU Compiler Collection <https://gcc.gnu.org/>`_.

    GNAT
        *GNAT* is the :term:`GNU` compiler for Ada, integrated into the
        :term:`GCC`.

    GNU
        This term is an acronym for `GNU's Not Unix <https://www.gnu.org/>`_.

    interrupt service
        An *interrupt service* consists of an
        :term:`Interrupt Service Routine` which is called with a user
        provided argument upon reception of an interrupt service request.  The
        routine is invoked in interrupt context.  Interrupt service requests may have
        a priority and an affinity to a set of processors.  An *interrupt service* is
        a :term:`software component`.

    Interrupt Service Routine
        An ISR is invoked by the CPU to process a pending interrupt.

    ISVV
        This term is an acronym for Independent Software Verification and Validation.

    LTL
        This term is an acronym for `Linear-time Temporal Logic <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_temporal_logic>`.

    nondeterministic
        This term refers to a choice being made in a system where the precise 
        (deterministic) reason for that choice is hard to reason about. The most 
        common example is when developing concurrent code, where often the only 
        practical approach is to assume that the sheduler is *nondeterministic*.

    refinement
        This term describes a relationship between the semantics of software
        engineering artifacts at different levels. This relationship characterises
        when a lower-level artifact can be viewed as a correct implementation of the
        corresponding high-level artifact. The most common form of refinement is that
        which relates a specification to the code that implements it.
        
    ReqIF
        This term is an acronym for
        `Requirements Interchange Format <https://www.omg.org/spec/ReqIF/About-ReqIF/>`_.

    RTEMS
        This term is an acronym for Real-Time Executive for Multiprocessor Systems.

    scenario
        This terms refers to a single run of a concurrent system where
        :term:`nondeterministic` choices have been resolved in some way. One form of
        :term:`semantics` for a concurrent system is the set of all possible
        *scenarios*. 

    semantics
        This term refers to the meaning of a language or notation.

    software component
        This term is defined by ECSS-E-ST-40C 3.2.28 as a "part of a software
        system".  For this project a *software component* shall be any of the
        following items and nothing else:

        * :term:`software unit`

        * explicitly defined :term:`ELF` symbol in a
          :term:`source code` file

        * :term:`assembler language` data in a source code file

        * :term:`C language` object with static storage duration

        * C language object with thread-local storage duration

        * :term:`thread`

        * :term:`interrupt service`

        * collection of *software components* (this is a software architecture
          element)

        Please note that explicitly defined ELF symbols and assembler language
        data are considered a software component only if they are defined in a
        :term:`source code` file.  For example, this rules out symbols
        and data generated as side-effects by the toolchain (compiler, assembler,
        linker) such as jump tables, linker trampolines, exception frame information,
        etc.

    software product
        The *software product* is the :term:`RTEMS` real-time operating system.

    software unit
        This term is defined by ECSS-E-ST-40C 3.2.24 as a "separately compilable
        piece of source code".  For this project a *software unit* shall be any of
        the following items and nothing else:

        * :term:`assembler language` function in a
          :term:`source code` file

        * :term:`C language` function (external and internal linkage)

        A *software unit* is a :term:`software component`.

    source code
        This project uses the *source code* definition of the
        `Linux Information Project <http://www.linfo.org/source_code.html>`_:
        "Source code (also referred to as source or code) is the version of
        software as it is originally written (i.e., typed into a computer) by a
        human in plain text (i.e., human readable alphanumeric characters)."

    task
        This project uses the
        `thread definition of Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)>`_:
        "a thread of execution is the smallest sequence of programmed
        instructions that can be managed independently by a scheduler, which is
        typically a part of the operating system."

        It consists normally of a set of registers and a stack.  The scheduler
        assigns processors to a subset of the ready tasks.  The terms task and
        :term:`thread` are synonym in RTEMS.  The term task is used
        throughout the Classic API, however, internally in the operating system
        implementation and the POSIX API the term thread is used.

        A *task* is a :term:`software component`.

    thread
        This term has the same meaning as :term:`task`.

    YAML
        This term is an acronym for `YAML Ain't Markup Language <https://yaml.org/>`_.
