File Templates
==============

Every source code file shall have a copyright and license block.  Corresponding
to the license, every file shall have an
`SPDX License Identifier <https://spdx.org/ids-how>`_ in the first possible line
of the file.  C/C++ files should have a Doxygen file comment block.

The preferred license for source code is
`BSD-2-Clause <https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause.html>`_.  The preferred
license for documentation is
`CC-BY-SA-4.0 <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode>`_.

.. _FileHeaderCopyright:

Copyright and License Block
---------------------------

You are the copyright holder.  Use the following copyright and license block for
your source code contributions to the RTEMS Project.  Place it after the SPDX
License Identifier line and the optional file documentation block. 

* In case you are a real person, then use the following format for
  <COPYRIGHT HOLDER>: <FIRST NAME> <MIDDLE NAMES> <LAST NAME>.  The <FIRST NAME>
  is your first name (also known as given name), the <MIDDLE NAMES> are your
  optional middle names, the <LAST NAME> is your last name (also known as family
  name).

* URLs are not permitted within the copyright block except for an email address
  for the copyright holder/author's contact information.

* Replace the <FIRST YEAR> placeholder with the year of your first substantial
  contribution to this file.  Update the <LAST YEAR> with the year of your last
  substantial contribution to this file.  If the first and last years are the
  same, then remove the <LAST YEAR> placeholder with the comma.  Replace the
  <COPYRIGHT HOLDER> placeholder with your name.

* If more than one copyright holder exists for a file, then sort the copyright
  lines by the first year (earlier years are below later years) followed by the
  copyright holder in alphabetical order (A is above B in the file).

Use the following template for a copyright and license block.  Do not change the
license text.

Check the top-level :file:`COPYING` file of the repository.  If you are a new
copyright holder, then add yourself to the top of the list.  If your last year
of a substantial contribution changed, then please update your copyright line.

.. _CCXXHeaderFileTemplate:

C/C++ Header File Template
--------------------------

Use the following guidelines and template for C and C++ header files (here
:file:`<foo/bar/baz.h>`):

* Place the SPDX License Identifier in the first line of the file.

* Add a Doxygen file documentation block.

* Place the copyright and license comment block after the documentation block.

* For the <FIRST YEAR>, <LAST YEAR>, and <COPYRIGHT HOLDER> placeholders see
  :ref:`FileHeaderCopyright`.

* Separate comment blocks by exactly one blank line.

* Separate the Doxygen comment block from the copyright and license, so that
  the copyright and license information is not included in the Doxygen output.

* For C++ header files discard the ``extern "C"`` start and end sections.

Python File Template
--------------------

Use the following template for Python source files. For the <FIRST YEAR>,
<LAST YEAR>, and <COPYRIGHT HOLDER> placeholders see
:ref:`FileHeaderCopyright`.

The ``File documentation block`` is a `Python docstring (PEP 257)
<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/>`_ module documentation
block. RTEMS uses ``"""`` for Python docstrings.

.. code-block:: python

If the Python source file is a command line command add the following as the
first line of the file:

.. code-block:: python

    #!/usr/bin/env python

A command line Python module does not need to have the ``.py`` file extension.

Only specify ``python`` as the command to ``env``. A system that does not
provide the ``python`` command can install a virtual python environment or the
user can prepend the specific Python versioned command to the Python script on
the command line when invoking the command.

Shell Scripts
-------------

Use the following template for shell script source files and other files which
accept a ``#``-style comment block. For the <FIRST YEAR>, <LAST YEAR>, and
<COPYRIGHT HOLDER> placeholders see :ref:`FileHeaderCopyright`.
