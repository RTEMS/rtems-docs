Directives
==========

This section details the directives of the Timer Manager. A subsection is
dedicated to each of this manager's directives and lists the calling sequence,
parameters, description, return values, and notes of the directive.

.. index:: rtems_timer_create()
.. index:: create a timer

.. _InterfaceRtemsTimerCreate:

rtems_timer_create()
--------------------

Creates a timer.

.. rubric:: CALLING SEQUENCE:

.. code-block:: c

    rtems_status_code rtems_timer_create( rtems_name name, rtems_id *id );

.. rubric:: PARAMETERS:

``name``
    This parameter is the object name of the timer.

``id``
    This parameter is the pointer to an :ref:`InterfaceRtemsId` object.  When
    the directive call is successful, the identifier of the created timer will
    be stored in this object.

.. rubric:: DESCRIPTION:

This directive creates a timer which resides on the local node.  The timer has
the user-defined object name specified in ``name``.  The assigned object
identifier is returned in ``id``.  This identifier is used to access the timer
with other timer related directives.

.. rubric:: RETURN VALUES:

:c:macro:`RTEMS_SUCCESSFUL`
    The requested operation was successful.

:c:macro:`RTEMS_INVALID_NAME`
    The ``name`` parameter was invalid.

:c:macro:`RTEMS_INVALID_ADDRESS`
    The ``id`` parameter was `NULL
    <https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/types/NULL>`_.

:c:macro:`RTEMS_TOO_MANY`
    There was no inactive object available to create a timer.  The number of
    timers available to the application is configured through the
    :ref:`CONFIGURE_MAXIMUM_TIMERS` application configuration option.

.. rubric:: NOTES:

The processor used to maintain the timer is the processor of the calling task
at some point during the timer creation.

For control and maintenance of the timer, RTEMS allocates a :term:`TMCB` from
the local TMCB free pool and initializes it.

.. rubric:: CONSTRAINTS:

The following constraints apply to this directive:

* The directive may be called from within device driver initialization context.

* The directive may be called from within task context.

* The directive may obtain and release the object allocator mutex.  This may
  cause the calling task to be preempted.

* The number of timers available to the application is configured through the
  :ref:`CONFIGURE_MAXIMUM_TIMERS` application configuration option.

* Where the object class corresponding to the directive is configured to use
  unlimited objects, the directive may allocate memory from the RTEMS
  Workspace.

.. index:: rtems_timer_ident()
.. index:: obtain the ID of a timer

.. _InterfaceRtemsTimerIdent:

rtems_timer_ident()
-------------------

Identifies a timer by the object name.

.. rubric:: CALLING SEQUENCE:

.. code-block:: c

    rtems_status_code rtems_timer_ident( rtems_name name, rtems_id *id );

.. rubric:: PARAMETERS:

``name``
    This parameter is the object name to look up.

``id``
    This parameter is the pointer to an :ref:`InterfaceRtemsId` object.  When
    the directive call is successful, the object identifier of an object with
    the specified name will be stored in this object.

.. rubric:: DESCRIPTION:

This directive obtains a timer identifier associated with the timer name
specified in ``name``.

.. rubric:: RETURN VALUES:

:c:macro:`RTEMS_SUCCESSFUL`
    The requested operation was successful.

:c:macro:`RTEMS_INVALID_ADDRESS`
    The ``id`` parameter was `NULL
    <https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/types/NULL>`_.

:c:macro:`RTEMS_INVALID_NAME`
    The ``name`` parameter was 0.

:c:macro:`RTEMS_INVALID_NAME`
    There was no object with the specified name on the local node.

.. rubric:: NOTES:

If the timer name is not unique, then the timer identifier will match the first
timer with that name in the search order.  However, this timer identifier is
not guaranteed to correspond to the desired timer.

The objects are searched from lowest to the highest index.  Only the local node
is searched.

The timer identifier is used with other timer related directives to access the
timer.

.. rubric:: CONSTRAINTS:

The following constraints apply to this directive:

* The directive may be called from within any runtime context.

* The directive will not cause the calling task to be preempted.

rtems_timer_cancel()
--------------------

Cancels the timer.

.. rubric:: CALLING SEQUENCE:

.. code-block:: c

    rtems_status_code rtems_timer_cancel( rtems_id id );

.. rubric:: PARAMETERS:

``id``
    This parameter is the timer identifier.

.. rubric:: DESCRIPTION:

This directive cancels the timer specified by ``id``.  This timer will be
reinitiated by the next invocation of :ref:`InterfaceRtemsTimerReset`,
:ref:`InterfaceRtemsTimerFireAfter`, :ref:`InterfaceRtemsTimerFireWhen`,
:ref:`InterfaceRtemsTimerServerFireAfter`, or
:ref:`InterfaceRtemsTimerServerFireWhen` with the same timer identifier.

.. rubric:: RETURN VALUES:

:c:macro:`RTEMS_SUCCESSFUL`
    The requested operation was successful.

:c:macro:`RTEMS_INVALID_ID`
    There was no timer associated with the identifier specified by ``id``.

.. rubric:: CONSTRAINTS:

The following constraints apply to this directive:

* The directive may be called from within interrupt context.

* The directive may be called from within device driver initialization context.

* The directive may be called from within task context.

* The directive will not cause the calling task to be preempted.

    rtems_status_code rtems_timer_delete( rtems_id id );

.. rubric:: PARAMETERS:

``id``
    This parameter is the timer identifier.

.. rubric:: DESCRIPTION:

This directive deletes the timer specified by ``id``.  If the timer is running,
it is automatically canceled.

.. rubric:: RETURN VALUES:

:c:macro:`RTEMS_SUCCESSFUL`
    The requested operation was successful.

:c:macro:`RTEMS_INVALID_ID`
    There was no timer associated with the identifier specified by ``id``.

The :term:`TMCB` for the deleted timer is reclaimed by RTEMS.

.. rubric:: CONSTRAINTS:

The following constraints apply to this directive:

* The directive may be called from within device driver initialization context.

* The directive may be called from within task context.

* The directive may obtain and release the object allocator mutex.  This may
  cause the calling task to be preempted.

* The calling task does not have to be the task that created the object.  Any
  local task that knows the object identifier can delete the object.

* Where the object class corresponding to the directive is configured to use
  unlimited objects, the directive may free memory to the RTEMS Workspace.

running, it is automatically canceled before being initiated.  The timer is
scheduled to fire after an interval of clock ticks has passed specified by
``ticks``.  When the timer fires, the timer service routine ``routine`` will be
invoked with the argument ``user_data`` in the context of the clock tick
:term:`ISR`.

.. rubric:: RETURN VALUES:

:c:macro:`RTEMS_SUCCESSFUL`
    The requested operation was successful.

:c:macro:`RTEMS_INVALID_NUMBER`
