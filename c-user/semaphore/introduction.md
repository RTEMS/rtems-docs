The Semaphore Manager utilizes standard Dijkstra counting semaphores to provide
synchronization and mutual exclusion capabilities. The directives provided by
the Semaphore Manager are:

* :ref:`InterfaceRtemsSemaphoreCreate` - Creates a semaphore.

* :ref:`InterfaceRtemsSemaphoreIdent` - Identifies a semaphore by the object
  name.

* :ref:`InterfaceRtemsSemaphoreDelete` - Deletes the semaphore.

* :ref:`InterfaceRtemsSemaphoreObtain` - Obtains the semaphore.

* :ref:`InterfaceRtemsSemaphoreRelease` - Releases the semaphore.

* :ref:`InterfaceRtemsSemaphoreFlush` - Flushes the semaphore.

* :ref:`InterfaceRtemsSemaphoreSetPriority` - Sets the priority by scheduler
  for the semaphore.
