critical system events. The directives provided by the User Extensions Manager

* :ref:`InterfaceRtemsExtensionCreate` - Creates an extension set.

* :ref:`InterfaceRtemsExtensionDelete` - Deletes the extension set.

* :ref:`InterfaceRtemsExtensionIdent` - Identifies an extension set by the
  object name.
