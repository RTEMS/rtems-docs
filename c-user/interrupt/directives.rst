.. _InterfaceRtemsInterruptCatch:

rtems_interrupt_catch()
-----------------------

Establishes an interrupt service routine.

.. rubric:: CALLING SEQUENCE:

.. code-block:: c

    rtems_status_code rtems_interrupt_catch(
      rtems_isr_entry     new_isr_handler,
      rtems_vector_number vector,
      rtems_isr_entry    *old_isr_handler
    );

.. rubric:: PARAMETERS:

``new_isr_handler``
    This parameter is the new interrupt service routine.

``vector``
    This parameter is the interrupt vector number.

``old_isr_handler``
    This parameter is the pointer to an :ref:`InterfaceRtemsIsrEntry` object.
    When the directive call is successful, the previous interrupt service
    routine established for this interrupt vector will be stored in this
    object.

.. rubric:: DESCRIPTION:

This directive establishes an interrupt service routine (ISR) for the interrupt
specified by the ``vector`` number.  The ``new_isr_handler`` parameter
specifies the entry point of the ISR.  The entry point of the previous ISR for
the specified vector is returned in ``old_isr_handler``.

To release an interrupt vector, pass the old handler's address obtained when
the vector was first capture.

.. rubric:: RETURN VALUES:

:c:macro:`RTEMS_SUCCESSFUL`
    The requested operation was successful.

:c:macro:`RTEMS_INVALID_NUMBER`
    The interrupt vector number was illegal.

:c:macro:`RTEMS_INVALID_ADDRESS`
    The ``new_isr_handler`` parameter was `NULL
    <https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/types/NULL>`_.

:c:macro:`RTEMS_INVALID_ADDRESS`
    The ``old_isr_handler`` parameter was `NULL
    <https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/types/NULL>`_.

.. rubric:: CONSTRAINTS:

The following constraints apply to this directive:

* The directive may be called from within interrupt context.

* The directive may be called from within device driver initialization context.

* The directive may be called from within task context.

* The directive will not cause the calling task to be preempted.

* The directive is only available where the :term:`target architecture` support
  enabled simple vectored interrupts.

.. _InterfaceRtemsInterruptDisable:

rtems_interrupt_disable()
-------------------------

Disables the maskable interrupts on the current processor.

.. rubric:: CALLING SEQUENCE:

.. code-block:: c

    void rtems_interrupt_disable( rtems_interrupt_level isr_cookie );

.. rubric:: PARAMETERS:

``isr_cookie``
    This parameter is a variable of type :ref:`InterfaceRtemsInterruptLevel`
    which will be used to save the previous interrupt level.

.. rubric:: DESCRIPTION:

This directive disables all maskable interrupts on the current processor and
returns the previous interrupt level in ``isr_cookie``.

.. rubric:: NOTES:

A later invocation of the :ref:`InterfaceRtemsInterruptEnable` directive should
be used to restore the previous interrupt level.

This directive is implemented as a macro which sets the ``isr_cookie``
parameter.

.. code-block:: c
    :linenos:

    #include <rtems.h>

    void local_critical_section( void )
    {
      rtems_interrupt_level level;

      // Please note that the rtems_interrupt_disable() is a macro.  The
      // previous interrupt level (before the maskable interrupts are
      // disabled) is returned here in the level macro parameter.  This
      // would be wrong:
      //
      // rtems_interrupt_disable( &level );
      rtems_interrupt_disable( level );

      // Here is the critical section: maskable interrupts are disabled

      {
        rtems_interrupt_level nested_level;

        rtems_interrupt_disable( nested_level );

        // Here is a nested critical section

        rtems_interrupt_enable( nested_level );
      }

      // Maskable interrupts are still disabled

      rtems_interrupt_enable( level );
    }

.. rubric:: CONSTRAINTS:

The following constraints apply to this directive:

* The directive may be called from within any runtime context.

* The directive will not cause the calling task to be preempted.

* Where the system was built with SMP support enabled, the directive is not
  available.  Its use will result in compiler warnings and linker errors.  The
  :ref:`InterfaceRtemsInterruptLocalDisable` and
  :ref:`InterfaceRtemsInterruptLocalEnable` directives are available in all
  build configurations.

.. _InterfaceRtemsInterruptEnable:

rtems_interrupt_enable()
------------------------

Restores the previous interrupt level on the current processor.

.. rubric:: CALLING SEQUENCE:

.. code-block:: c

    void rtems_interrupt_enable( rtems_interrupt_level isr_cookie );

.. rubric:: PARAMETERS:

``isr_cookie``
    This parameter is the previous interrupt level to restore.  The value must
    be obtained by a previous call to :ref:`InterfaceRtemsInterruptDisable` or
    :ref:`InterfaceRtemsInterruptFlash`.

.. rubric:: DESCRIPTION:

This directive restores the interrupt level specified by ``isr_cookie`` on the
current processor.

.. rubric:: NOTES:

The ``isr_cookie`` parameter value must be obtained by a previous call to
:ref:`InterfaceRtemsInterruptDisable` or :ref:`InterfaceRtemsInterruptFlash`.
Using an otherwise obtained value is undefined behaviour.

This directive is unsuitable to enable particular interrupt sources, for
example in an interrupt controller.

.. rubric:: CONSTRAINTS:

The following constraints apply to this directive:

* The directive may be called from within any runtime context.

* The directive will not cause the calling task to be preempted.

* While at least one maskable interrupt is pending, when the directive enables
  maskable interrupts, the pending interrupts are immediately serviced.  The
  interrupt service routines may unblock higher priority tasks which may
  preempt the calling task.

* Where the system was built with SMP support enabled, the directive is not
  available.  Its use will result in compiler warnings and linker errors.  The
  :ref:`InterfaceRtemsInterruptLocalDisable` and
  :ref:`InterfaceRtemsInterruptLocalEnable` directives are available in all
  build configurations.

.. _InterfaceRtemsInterruptFlash:

rtems_interrupt_flash()
-----------------------

Flashes interrupts on the current processor.

.. rubric:: CALLING SEQUENCE:

.. code-block:: c

    void rtems_interrupt_flash( rtems_interrupt_level isr_cookie );

.. rubric:: PARAMETERS:

``isr_cookie``
    This parameter is the previous interrupt level.

.. rubric:: DESCRIPTION:

This directive is functionally equivalent to a calling
:ref:`InterfaceRtemsInterruptEnable` immediately followed by a
:ref:`InterfaceRtemsInterruptDisable`.  On some architectures it is possible to
provide an optimized implementation for this sequence.

.. rubric:: NOTES:

The ``isr_cookie`` parameter value must be obtained by a previous call to
:ref:`InterfaceRtemsInterruptDisable` or :ref:`InterfaceRtemsInterruptFlash`.
Using an otherwise obtained value is undefined behaviour.

Historically, the interrupt flash directive was heavily used in the operating
system implementation.  However, this is no longer the case.  The interrupt
flash directive is provided for backward compatibility reasons.

.. rubric:: CONSTRAINTS:

The following constraints apply to this directive:

* The directive may be called from within any runtime context.

* The directive will not cause the calling task to be preempted.

* Where the system was built with SMP support enabled, the directive is not
  available.  Its use will result in compiler warnings and linker errors.  The
  :ref:`InterfaceRtemsInterruptLocalDisable` and
  :ref:`InterfaceRtemsInterruptLocalEnable` directives are available in all

rtems_interrupt_local_disable()
-------------------------------

Disables the maskable interrupts on the current processor.

.. rubric:: CALLING SEQUENCE:

.. code-block:: c

    void rtems_interrupt_local_disable( rtems_interrupt_level isr_cookie );

.. rubric:: PARAMETERS:

``isr_cookie``
    This parameter is a variable of type :ref:`InterfaceRtemsInterruptLevel`
    which will be used to save the previous interrupt level.

.. rubric:: DESCRIPTION:

This directive disables all maskable interrupts on the current processor and
returns the previous interrupt level in ``isr_cookie``.

.. rubric:: NOTES:

A later invocation of the :ref:`InterfaceRtemsInterruptLocalEnable` directive
should be used to restore the previous interrupt level.

This directive is implemented as a macro which sets the ``isr_cookie``
parameter.

Where the system was built with SMP support enabled, this will not ensure
system wide mutual exclusion.  Use interrupt locks instead, see
:ref:`InterfaceRtemsInterruptLockAcquire`.  Interrupt disabled critical
sections may be used to access processor-specific data structures or disable
thread dispatching.

.. code-block:: c
    :linenos:

    #include <rtems.h>

    void local_critical_section( void )
    {
      rtems_interrupt_level level;

      // Please note that the rtems_interrupt_local_disable() is a macro.

rtems_interrupt_is_in_progress()
--------------------------------

Checks if an ISR is in progress on the current processor.

.. rubric:: CALLING SEQUENCE:

.. code-block:: c

    bool rtems_interrupt_is_in_progress( void );

.. rubric:: DESCRIPTION:

This directive returns ``true``, if the current processor is currently
servicing an interrupt, and ``false`` otherwise.  A return value of ``true``
indicates that the caller is an interrupt service routine, **not** a task. The
directives available to an interrupt service routine are restricted.

.. rubric:: RETURN VALUES:

Returns true, if the current processor is currently servicing an interrupt,
otherwise false.

.. rubric:: CONSTRAINTS:

The following constraints apply to this directive:

.. rubric:: PARAMETERS:

``lock``
    This parameter is the ISR lock to initialize.

``name``
    This parameter is the ISR lock name.  It shall be a string.  The name is
    only used where the system was built with profiling support enabled.

.. rubric:: NOTES:

ISR locks may also be statically defined by
:ref:`InterfaceRTEMSINTERRUPTLOCKDEFINE` or statically initialized by
:ref:`InterfaceRTEMSINTERRUPTLOCKINITIALIZER`.

.. code-block:: c

    void rtems_interrupt_lock_destroy( rtems_interrupt_lock *lock );

.. rubric:: PARAMETERS:

``lock``
    This parameter is the ISR lock to destroy.

.. rubric:: NOTES:

The lock must have been dynamically initialized by
:ref:`InterfaceRtemsInterruptLockInitialize`, statically defined by
:ref:`InterfaceRTEMSINTERRUPTLOCKDEFINE`, or statically initialized by
:ref:`InterfaceRTEMSINTERRUPTLOCKINITIALIZER`.

Concurrent lock use during the destruction or concurrent destruction leads to
unpredictable results.

.. rubric:: PARAMETERS:

``lock``
    This parameter is the ISR lock to acquire.

``lock_context``
    This parameter is the ISR lock context.  This lock context shall be used to
    release the lock by calling :ref:`InterfaceRtemsInterruptLockRelease`.

.. rubric:: DESCRIPTION:

This directive acquires the ISR lock specified by ``lock`` using the lock
context provided by ``lock_context``.  Maskable interrupts will be disabled on
the current processor.

.. rubric:: NOTES:

A caller-specific lock context shall be provided for each acquire/release pair,
for example an automatic variable.

Where the system was built with SMP support enabled, this directive acquires an
SMP lock.  An attempt to recursively acquire the lock may result in an infinite
loop with maskable interrupts disabled.

This directive establishes a non-preemptive critical section with system wide
mutual exclusion on the local node in all RTEMS build configurations.

.. rubric:: PARAMETERS:

``lock``
    This parameter is the ISR lock to acquire within an ISR.

``lock_context``
    This parameter is the ISR lock context.  This lock context shall be used to
    release the lock by calling :ref:`InterfaceRtemsInterruptLockReleaseIsr`.

.. rubric:: DESCRIPTION:

This directive acquires the ISR lock specified by ``lock`` using the lock
context provided by ``lock_context``.  The interrupt level will remain
unchanged.

.. rubric:: NOTES:

A caller-specific lock context shall be provided for each acquire/release pair,
for example an automatic variable.

Where the system was built with SMP support enabled, this directive acquires an
SMP lock.  An attempt to recursively acquire the lock may result in an infinite
loop.

This directive is intended for device drivers and should be called from the
corresponding interrupt service routine.

In case the corresponding interrupt service routine can be interrupted by
higher priority interrupts and these interrupts enter the critical section
protected by this lock, then the result is unpredictable.  This directive may
be used under specific circumstances as an optimization.  In doubt, use
:ref:`InterfaceRtemsInterruptLockAcquire` and
:ref:`InterfaceRtemsInterruptLockRelease`.

:term:`target`.  It is strongly recommended to read the relevant hardware
documentation.  What happens when the priority of a pending or active interrupt
is changed, depends on the interrupt controller.  In general, you should set
the interrupt priority of an interrupt vector before a handler is installed.
On some interrupt controllers, setting the priority to the maximum value
(lowest importance) effectively disables the interrupt.

On some architectures, a range of interrupt priority values may be not disabled
by the interrupt disable directives such as
:ref:`InterfaceRtemsInterruptDisable` and
:ref:`InterfaceRtemsInterruptLocalDisable`.  These interrupts are called
non-maskable interrupts. Handlers of non-maskable interrupts shall not use
operating system services. In addition, non-maskable interrupts may be not
installable through :ref:`InterfaceRtemsInterruptEntryInstall` or
:ref:`InterfaceRtemsInterruptHandlerInstall`, and may require
architecture-specific prologue and epilogue code.

The interrupt priority settings affect the maximum nesting depth while
servicing interrupts.  The interrupt stack size calculation needs to take this
into account, see also :ref:`CONFIGURE_INTERRUPT_STACK_SIZE`.

For the ARM Generic Interrupt Controller (GIC), an 8-bit priority value is
supported.  The granularity of the priority levels depends on the interrupt
controller configuration.  Some low-order bits of a priority value may be
read-as-zero (RAZ) and writes are ignored (WI).  Where group 0 (FIQ) and group
1 (IRQ) interrupts are used, it is recommended to use the lower half of the
supported priority value range for the group 0 interrupts and the upper half
for group 1 interrupts.  This ensures that group 1 interrupts cannot preempt
group 0 interrupts.

For the Armv7-M Nested Vector Interrupt Controller (NVIC), an 8-bit priority
value is supported.  The granularity of the priority levels depends on the
interrupt controller configuration.  Some lower bits of a priority value may be
read-as-zero (RAZ) and writes are ignored (WI).  Interrupts with a priority
value less than 128 are not disabled by the RTEMS interrupt disable directives.
Handlers of such interrupts shall not use operating system services.

For the RISC-V Platform-Level Interrupt Controller (PLIC), all priority values
from 0 up to and including the 0xffffffff are supported since the priority for
the PLIC is defined by a write-any-read-legal (WARL) register. Please note that
for this directive in contrast to the PLIC, a higher priority value is
associated with a lower importance.  The maximum priority value (mapped to the
value 0 for the PLIC) is reserved to mean "never interrupt" and effectively
disables the interrupt.

For the QorIQ Multicore Programmable Interrupt Controller (MPIC), a 4-bit
priority value is supported.  Please note that for this directive in contrast
to the MPIC, a higher priority value is associated with a lower importance. The
maximum priority value of 15 (mapped to the value 0 for the MPIC) inhibits
signalling of this interrupt.

Consult the *RTEMS CPU Architecture Supplement* and the :term:`BSP`
documentation in the *RTEMS User Manual* for further information.
