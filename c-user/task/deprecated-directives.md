DESCRIPTION:
    This directive iterates over all of the existant threads in the system and
    invokes ``routine`` on each of them.  The user should be careful in
    accessing the contents of ``the_thread``.

    This routine is intended for use in diagnostic utilities and is not
    intented for routine use in an operational system.

NOTES:
    There is **no protection** while this routine is called.  The thread
    control block may be in an inconsistent state or may change due to
    interrupts or activity on other processors.
