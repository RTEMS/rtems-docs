------------------------------------------------

.. rubric:: CONSTANT:

``CONFIGURE_APPLICATION_DOES_NOT_NEED_CLOCK_DRIVER``

.. rubric:: OPTION TYPE:

This configuration option is a boolean feature define.

.. rubric:: DEFAULT CONFIGURATION:

If this configuration option is undefined, then a Clock Driver may be
initialized during system initialization.

.. rubric:: DESCRIPTION:

In case this configuration option is defined, then **no** Clock Driver is
initialized during system initialization.

.. rubric:: NOTES:

This configuration parameter is intended to prevent the common user error
of using the Hello World example as the baseline for an application and
leaving out a clock tick source.

The application shall define exactly one of the following configuration options

* :ref:`CONFIGURE_APPLICATION_NEEDS_CLOCK_DRIVER`,

* ``CONFIGURE_APPLICATION_DOES_NOT_NEED_CLOCK_DRIVER``, or

* :ref:`CONFIGURE_APPLICATION_NEEDS_TIMER_DRIVER`,

otherwise a compile time error in the configuration file will occur.

.. rubric:: CONSTANT:

``CONFIGURE_APPLICATION_EXTRA_DRIVERS``

.. rubric:: OPTION TYPE:

This configuration option is an initializer define.

.. rubric:: DEFAULT VALUE:

The default value is the empty list.

.. rubric:: DESCRIPTION:

The value of this configuration option is used to initialize the Device
Driver Table.

.. rubric:: NOTES:

The value of this configuration option is placed after the entries of other
device driver configuration options.

See :ref:`CONFIGURE_APPLICATION_PREREQUISITE_DRIVERS` for an alternative
placement of application device driver initializers.

.. rubric:: CONSTRAINTS:

This configuration option is a boolean feature define.

.. rubric:: DEFAULT CONFIGURATION:

If this configuration option is undefined, then the described feature is not
enabled.

.. rubric:: DESCRIPTION:

In case this configuration option is defined, then the ATA Driver is
initialized during system initialization.

.. rubric:: NOTES:

Most BSPs do not include support for an ATA Driver.

If this configuration option is undefined, then the described feature is not
enabled.

.. rubric:: DESCRIPTION:

In case this configuration option is defined, then the Clock Driver is
initialized during system initialization.

.. rubric:: NOTES:

The Clock Driver is responsible for providing a regular interrupt
which invokes a clock tick directive.

The application shall define exactly one of the following configuration options

* ``CONFIGURE_APPLICATION_NEEDS_CLOCK_DRIVER``,

.. rubric:: DEFAULT CONFIGURATION:

If this configuration option is undefined, then the described feature is not
enabled.

.. rubric:: DESCRIPTION:

In case this configuration option is defined, then the Console Driver is
initialized during system initialization.

.. rubric:: NOTES:

The Console Driver is responsible for providing the :file:`/dev/console`
device file.  This device is used to initialize the standard input, output,
and error file descriptors.

BSPs should be constructed in a manner that allows :ref:`InterfacePrintk` to work
properly without the need for the Console Driver to be configured.

The

* ``CONFIGURE_APPLICATION_NEEDS_CONSOLE_DRIVER``,

* :ref:`CONFIGURE_APPLICATION_NEEDS_SIMPLE_CONSOLE_DRIVER`, and

enabled.

.. rubric:: DESCRIPTION:

In case this configuration option is defined, then the Frame Buffer Driver is
initialized during system initialization.

.. rubric:: NOTES:

Most BSPs do not include support for a Frame Buffer Driver. This is
because many boards do not include the required hardware.

If this option is defined and the BSP does not have this device driver, then
the user will get a link time error for an undefined symbol.

enabled.

.. rubric:: DESCRIPTION:

In case this configuration option is defined, then the Real-Time Clock Driver
is initialized during system initialization.

.. rubric:: NOTES:

Most BSPs do not include support for a real-time clock (RTC). This is because

If this configuration option is undefined, then the described feature is not
enabled.

.. rubric:: DESCRIPTION:

In case this configuration option is defined, then the Simple Console Driver
is initialized during system initialization.

.. rubric:: NOTES:

This device driver is responsible for providing the :file:`/dev/console`
device file.  This device is used to initialize the standard input, output,
and error file descriptors.

This device driver reads via :ref:`InterfaceGetchark`.

This device driver writes via :ref:`InterfaceRtemsPutc`.

The Termios framework is not used.  There is no support to change device
settings, e.g. baud, stop bits, parity, etc.

The

* :ref:`CONFIGURE_APPLICATION_NEEDS_CONSOLE_DRIVER`,

* ``CONFIGURE_APPLICATION_NEEDS_SIMPLE_CONSOLE_DRIVER``, and

* :ref:`CONFIGURE_APPLICATION_NEEDS_SIMPLE_TASK_CONSOLE_DRIVER`

configuration options are mutually exclusive.

This configuration option is a boolean feature define.

.. rubric:: DEFAULT CONFIGURATION:

If this configuration option is undefined, then the described feature is not
enabled.

.. rubric:: DESCRIPTION:

In case this configuration option is defined, then the Simple Task Console
Driver is initialized during system initialization.

.. rubric:: NOTES:

This device driver is responsible for providing the :file:`/dev/console`
device file.  This device is used to initialize the standard input, output,
and error file descriptors.

This device driver reads via :ref:`InterfaceGetchark`.

This device driver writes into a write buffer.  The count of characters
written into the write buffer is returned.  It might be less than the
requested count, in case the write buffer is full.  The write is
non-blocking and may be called from interrupt context.  A dedicated task
reads from the write buffer and outputs the characters via
:ref:`InterfaceRtemsPutc`.  This task runs with the least important priority.
The write buffer size is 2047 characters and it is not configurable.

Use ``fsync( STDOUT_FILENO )`` or ``fdatasync( STDOUT_FILENO )`` to drain the
write buffer.

The Termios framework is not used.  There is no support to change device
settings, e.g.  baud, stop bits, parity, etc.

The

* :ref:`CONFIGURE_APPLICATION_NEEDS_CONSOLE_DRIVER`,

* :ref:`CONFIGURE_APPLICATION_NEEDS_SIMPLE_CONSOLE_DRIVER`, and

* ``CONFIGURE_APPLICATION_NEEDS_SIMPLE_TASK_CONSOLE_DRIVER``

configuration options are mutually exclusive.
