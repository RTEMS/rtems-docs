FACE Technical Standard Related Configuration
=============================================

This section describes configuration options related to adapting
RTEMS behavior to be aligned with the FACE Technical Standard.
The FACE Technical Standard is a product of the FACE Consortium
which operates under the Open Group. The FACE Consortium was founded
by avionics organizations to improve the portability of cockpit software
across various platforms. It addresses technical and business concerns.

Most important from an RTEMS perspective, the FACE Technical Standard
defines four POSIX profiles: Security, Safety Base, Safety Extended, and
the General Purpose Profile. Each has an increasingly larger subset of
POSIX APIs. In the Security and Safety profiles, ARINC 653 is required.
It is optional in the General Purpose Profile.

The RTEMS Project has been tracking alignment with the FACE POSIX profiles
and they are included in the "RTEMS POSIX 1003.1 Compliance Guide."

CONFIGURE_POSIX_TIMERS_FACE_BEHAVIOR
------------------------------------

.. rubric:: CONSTANT:

``CONFIGURE_POSIX_TIMERS_FACE_BEHAVIOR``

.. rubric:: OPTION TYPE:

This configuration option is a boolean feature define.

.. rubric:: DEFAULT CONFIGURATION:

If this configuration option is undefined, then the described feature is not
enabled.

.. rubric:: DESCRIPTION:

If this configuration option is defined, then POSIX timers may not be created
to use the :term:`CLOCK_REALTIME`.  Per POSIX, this is allowed
behavior but per the FACE Technical Standard, it is not. Using POSIX timers
based on CLOCK_REALTIME (e.g., time of day) is unsafe for real-time safety
systems as setting CLOCK_REALTIME will perturb any active timers.

If this option is not defined, POSIX timers may be created to use the
CLOCK_REALTIME in compliance with the POSIX specification.
