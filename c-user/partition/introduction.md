The Partition Manager provides facilities to dynamically allocate memory in
fixed-size units. The directives provided by the Partition Manager are:

* :ref:`InterfaceRtemsPartitionCreate` - Creates a partition.

* :ref:`InterfaceRtemsPartitionIdent` - Identifies a partition by the object
  name.

* :ref:`InterfaceRtemsPartitionDelete` - Deletes the partition.

* :ref:`InterfaceRtemsPartitionGetBuffer` - Tries to get a buffer from the
  partition.

* :ref:`InterfaceRtemsPartitionReturnBuffer` - Returns the buffer to the
  partition.
