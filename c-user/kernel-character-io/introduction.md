The kernel character input/output support is an extension of the
:ref:`RTEMSAPIClassicIO` to output characters to the kernel character output
device and receive characters from the kernel character input device using a
polled and non-blocking implementation.

The directives may be used to print debug and test information.  The kernel
character input/output support should work even if no Console Driver is
configured, see :ref:`CONFIGURE_APPLICATION_NEEDS_CONSOLE_DRIVER`.  The kernel
character input and output device is provided by the :term:`BSP`. Applications
may change the device. The directives provided by the Kernel Character I/O
Support are:

* :ref:`InterfaceRtemsPutc` - Outputs the character to the kernel character
  output device.

* :ref:`InterfaceRtemsPutChar` - Puts the character using
  :ref:`InterfaceRtemsPutc`

* :ref:`InterfacePutk` - Outputs the characters of the string and a newline
  character to the kernel character output device.

* :ref:`InterfacePrintk` - Outputs the characters defined by the format string
  and the arguments to the kernel character output device.

* :ref:`InterfaceVprintk` - Outputs the characters defined by the format string
  and the variable argument list to the kernel character output device.

* :ref:`InterfaceRtemsPrintkPrinter` - Outputs the characters defined by the
  format string and the variable argument list to the kernel character output
  device.

* :ref:`InterfaceGetchark` - Tries to dequeue a character from the kernel
  character input device.
