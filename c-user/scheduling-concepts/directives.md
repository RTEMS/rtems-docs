Where the system was built with SMP support disabled, this directive evaluates
to a compile time constant of zero.

Where the system was built with SMP support enabled, this directive returns the
index of the current processor.  The set of processor indices is the range of
integers starting with zero up to

Where the system was built with SMP support enabled, this directive returns the
minimum of the processors (physically or virtually) available at the
:term:`target` and the configured processor maximum (see

maximum minus one) may be configured to be used by a scheduler or may be online
(online processors have a scheduler assigned).
