greater than zero, then the stored object name will be ``NUL`` terminated. The
stored object name may be truncated to fit the length.  There is no indication
if a truncation occurred.  Every attempt is made to return name as a printable
string even if the object has the Classic API 32-bit integer style name.

.. rubric:: RETURN VALUES:

    The ``length`` parameter was 0.

`NULL <https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/types/NULL>`_

.. rubric:: NOTES:

This directive can be used to set the name of objects which do not have a
naming scheme per their API.

If the object specified by ``id`` is of a class that has a string name, this
directive will free the existing name to the RTEMS Workspace and allocate
enough memory from the RTEMS Workspace to make a copy of the string located at
``name``.

If the object specified by ``id`` is of a class that has a 32-bit integer style
name, then the first four characters in ``name`` will be used to construct the
name.

.. rubric:: CONSTRAINTS:

The following constraints apply to this directive:

* The directive may be called from within device driver initialization context.

* The directive may be called from within task context.

* The directive may obtain and release the object allocator mutex.  This may
  cause the calling task to be preempted.
