The Rate-Monotonic Manager provides facilities to implement tasks which execute
in a periodic fashion.  Critically, it also gathers information about the
execution of those periods and can provide important statistics to the user
which can be used to analyze and tune the application. The directives provided
by the Rate-Monotonic Manager are:

* :ref:`InterfaceRtemsRateMonotonicCreate` - Creates a period.

* :ref:`InterfaceRtemsRateMonotonicIdent` - Identifies a period by the object
  name.

* :ref:`InterfaceRtemsRateMonotonicCancel` - Cancels the period.

* :ref:`InterfaceRtemsRateMonotonicDelete` - Deletes the period.

* :ref:`InterfaceRtemsRateMonotonicPeriod` - Concludes the current period and
  start the next period, or gets the period status.

* :ref:`InterfaceRtemsRateMonotonicGetStatus` - Gets the detailed status of the
  period.

* :ref:`InterfaceRtemsRateMonotonicGetStatistics` - Gets the statistics of the
  period.

* :ref:`InterfaceRtemsRateMonotonicResetStatistics` - Resets the statistics of
  the period.

* :ref:`InterfaceRtemsRateMonotonicResetAllStatistics` - Resets the statistics
  of all periods.

* :ref:`InterfaceRtemsRateMonotonicReportStatistics` - Reports the period
  statistics using the :ref:`InterfacePrintk` printer.

* :ref:`InterfaceRtemsRateMonotonicReportStatisticsWithPlugin` - Reports the
  period statistics using the printer plugin.
