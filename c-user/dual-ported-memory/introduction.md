The Dual-Ported Memory Manager provides a mechanism for converting addresses
between internal and external representations for multiple dual-ported memory
areas (DPMA). The directives provided by the Dual-Ported Memory Manager are:

* :ref:`InterfaceRtemsPortCreate` - Creates a port.

* :ref:`InterfaceRtemsPortIdent` - Identifies a port by the object name.

* :ref:`InterfaceRtemsPortDelete` - Deletes the port.

* :ref:`InterfaceRtemsPortExternalToInternal` - Converts the external address
  to the internal address.

* :ref:`InterfaceRtemsPortInternalToExternal` - Converts the internal address
  to the external address.
