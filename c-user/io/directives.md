Directives
==========

This section details the directives of the I/O Manager. A subsection is
dedicated to each of this manager's directives and lists the calling sequence,
parameters, description, return values, and notes of the directive.

.. index:: rtems_io_register_driver()
.. index:: register a device driver

.. _InterfaceRtemsIoRegisterDriver:

rtems_io_register_driver()
--------------------------

Registers and initializes the device with the specified device driver address
table and device major number in the Device Driver Table.

.. rubric:: CALLING SEQUENCE:

.. code-block:: c

    rtems_status_code rtems_io_register_driver(
      rtems_device_major_number         major,
      const rtems_driver_address_table *driver_table,
      rtems_device_major_number        *registered_major
    );

.. rubric:: PARAMETERS:

``major``
    This parameter is the device major number.  Use a value of zero to let the
    system obtain a device major number automatically.

``driver_table``
    This parameter is the device driver address table.

``registered_major``
    This parameter is the pointer to an :ref:`InterfaceRtemsDeviceMajorNumber`
    object.  When the directive call is successful, the device major number of
    the registered device will be stored in this object.

.. rubric:: RETURN VALUES:

:c:macro:`RTEMS_SUCCESSFUL`
    The requested operation was successful.

:c:macro:`RTEMS_INVALID_ADDRESS`
    The device major number of the device was `NULL
    <https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/types/NULL>`_.

:c:macro:`RTEMS_INVALID_ADDRESS`
    The device driver address table was empty.

:c:macro:`RTEMS_INVALID_NUMBER`
    The device major number of the device was out of range, see
    :ref:`CONFIGURE_MAXIMUM_DRIVERS`.

:c:macro:`RTEMS_TOO_MANY`
    The system was unable to obtain a device major number.

:c:macro:`RTEMS_RESOURCE_IN_USE`
    The device major number was already in use.

:c:macro:`RTEMS_CALLED_FROM_ISR`
    The directive was called from interrupt context.

Other status codes may be returned by :ref:`InterfaceRtemsIoInitialize`.

.. rubric:: NOTES:

If the device major number equals zero a device major number will be obtained.
The device major number of the registered driver will be returned.

After a successful registration, the :ref:`InterfaceRtemsIoInitialize`
directive will be called to initialize the device.

This directive is automatically invoked for each device driver defined by the
application configuration during the system initialization and via the
:ref:`InterfaceRtemsIoRegisterDriver` directive.

hardware and data structures associated with a device.  If necessary, it can
allocate memory to be used during other operations.

.. rubric:: NOTES:

The exact functionality of the driver entry called by this directive is driver
dependent.  It should not be assumed that the control entries of two device
drivers are compatible.  For example, an RS-232 driver I/O control operation
may change the baud of a serial line, while an I/O control operation for a
floppy disk driver may cause a seek operation.
