The Input/Output (I/O) Manager provides a well-defined mechanism for accessing
device drivers and a structured methodology for organizing device drivers. The
directives provided by the I/O Manager are:

* :ref:`InterfaceRtemsIoRegisterDriver` - Registers and initializes the device
  with the specified device driver address table and device major number in the
  Device Driver Table.

* :ref:`InterfaceRtemsIoUnregisterDriver` - Removes a device driver specified
  by the device major number from the Device Driver Table.

* :ref:`InterfaceRtemsIoInitialize` - Initializes the device specified by the
  device major and minor numbers.

* :ref:`InterfaceRtemsIoRegisterName` - Registers the device specified by the
  device major and minor numbers in the file system under the specified name.

* :ref:`InterfaceRtemsIoOpen` - Opens the device specified by the device major
  and minor numbers.

* :ref:`InterfaceRtemsIoClose` - Closes the device specified by the device
  major and minor numbers.

* :ref:`InterfaceRtemsIoRead` - Reads from the device specified by the device
  major and minor numbers.

* :ref:`InterfaceRtemsIoWrite` - Writes to the device specified by the device
  major and minor numbers.

* :ref:`InterfaceRtemsIoControl` - Controls the device specified by the device
  major and minor numbers.
