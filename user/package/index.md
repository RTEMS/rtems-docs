# Packages

This section provides information for various add-on-packages for RTEMS (like
various network stacks) that are maintained by the RTEMS community.

Note that earlier versions (up to 5) of RTEMS included this kind of software
into the RTEMS core repository. Starting from RTEMS 6, such add-on-packages
should now be in separate repositories to allow more flexibility. For example,
the network stack that had been included in RTEMS 5 is now maintained
separately and alternative stacks have been added as separate packages.
