# About this Manual

This manual provides information for various bigger add-on-packages for RTEMS
that are maintained by the RTEMS community like various network stacks.

Note that earlier versions (up to 5) of RTEMS included this kind of software
into the RTEMS core repository. Starting from RTEMS 6, such add-on-packages
should now be in separate repositories to allow more flexibility. For example,
the network stack that had been included in RTEMS 5 is now maintained
separately and alternative stacks have been added as separate packages.
