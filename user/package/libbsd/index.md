# LibBSD - FreeBSD Network and Driver Stack

```{index} LibBSD Network Stack

```{index} LibBSD

The RTEMS LibBSD is a framework to port various drivers and subsystems from
FreeBSD to RTEMS. Main features are:

- full-featured network stack
- USB stack
- SDIO stack
- PCI(e) support
- libraries like OpenSSL
- user space tools for networking like dhcpcd

One of its main goals is to make it possible to keep in sync with an up-to-date
FreeBSD version.
