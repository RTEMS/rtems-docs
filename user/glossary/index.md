# Glossary

```{glossary}
ABI

: Application Binary Interface

Architecture

: Family or class of processor based around a common instruction set. RTEMS
  architectures follow the GCC architecture model as RTEMS needs an GCC
  architecture compiler for each support RTEMS architecture.

APA

: Arbitrary Processor Affinity

API

: Application Programming Interface

Binutils

: GNU Binary Utilities such as the assembler `as`, linker `ld` and a
  range of other tools used in the development of software.

BSP

: Board Support Package is a specific configuration RTEMS can be built
  for. An RTEMS install process installs specific library and headers files
  for a single BSP. A BSP optimises RTEMS to a specific target hardware.

Buildbot

: A continuous inteagration build server.

C11

: ISO/IEC 9899:2011

C++11

: ISO/IEC 14882:2011

Crosscompiler

> A compiler built to run on a Host that generate code for another
> architecture.

DLL

: Dynamically Linker Library used on Windows.

EDF

: Earliest Deadline First

EMBÂ²

: [Embedded Multicore Building Blocks](https://embb.io)

FAT

: File Allocation Table

Futex

: Fast User-Space Locking

IMFS

: In-Memory File System

JFFS2

: Journalling Flash File System version 2

GCC

: GNU Compiler Collection

GDB

: GNU Debugger

GNU

: GNU's Not Unix

Host

: The computer and operating system that hosts the RTEMS development tools
  such as the compiler, linker and debugger.

MinGW

: Minimal GNU system for Windows that lets GCC built programs use the
  standard Windows operating system DLLs. It lets you build native Windows
  programs with the GNU GCC compiler.

MinGW64

: Minimal GNU system for 64bit Windows. MinGW64 is not the MinGW project.

MrsP

: Multiprocessor Resource-Sharing Protocol

MSYS2

: Minimal System 2 is a fork of the MinGW project's MSYS tool and the MinGW
  MSYS tool is a fork of Cygwin project. The Cygwin project provides a POSIX
  emulation layer for Windows so POSIX software can run on Windows. MSYS is a
  minimal version that is just enough to let `configure` scripts run. MSYS
  has a simplified path structure to make it easier to building native Windows
  programs.

NFSv2

: Network File System version 2

OMIP

: $O(m)$ Independence-Preserving Protocol

OpenMP

: Open Multi-Processing

POSIX

: Portable Operating System Interface is a standard that lets software be
  portable between compliant operating systems.

prefix

: A path used when building a package so all parts of the package reside
  under that path.

RFS

: RTEMS File System

RSB

: RTEMS Source Builder is part of the RTEMS Tools Project. It builds packages
  such as the tools for the RTEMS operating system.

RTEMS

: The Real-Time Executive for Multiprocessor Systems or RTEMS is an open
  source fully featured Real Time Operating System or RTOS that supports a
  variety of open standard application programming interfaces (API) and
  interface standards such as POSIX and BSD sockets.

SMP

: Symmetric Multiprocessing

Target

: A target is the hardware or simulator a BSP built executable runs on.

Test Suite

: See Testsuite

Testsuite

: RTEMS test suite located in the `testsuites/` directory.

TLS

: Thread-Local Storage

Waf

: Waf build system. For more information see <http://www.waf.io/>

YAFFS2

: [Yet Another Flash File System version 2](https://gitlab.rtems.org/sebhub/rtems-yaffs2)
