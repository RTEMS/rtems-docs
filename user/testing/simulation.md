Simulation is a important regression and development tool for RTEMS. Developers
use simulation to work on core parts of RTEMS as it provides excellent
debugging supporting. Simulation run via the RTEMS Tester allows a test to run
on each core of your testing host machine lower the time to run all tests.

   RTEMS Tester Simulation

The :ref:`fig-tester-simulation` figure shows the structure of RTEMS Testing
using simulation. The executables are built and the ``rtems-test`` command is
run from the top of the build directory. The RTEMS Tester executes the
BSP specific simulator for each test capturing the output
