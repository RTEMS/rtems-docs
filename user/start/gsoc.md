# GSoC Getting Started

The goal of this page is to help new contributors get RTEMS compiled and
running so they can start with the real work. It is specifically meant for
prospective applicants to Google Summer of Code, but should be helpful for
anyone who wants to get in to development and contributing to RTEMS.

Please join the {r:url}`discord` and ask questions in the `#gsoc` channel.

Help correct any deficiencies in the code or documentation you spot,
including those on the website. The ultimate goal of GSoC is to help you become
part of the open source community, and there is no better way to start than by
fixing small errors in the getting started resources.

This section will help you to quickly setup a development environment without
delving into the details. For more information you can go through the other
subsections under {ref}`Quick Start <QuickStart>` chapter, ask in
{r:url}`discord`, or ask on the {r:list}`users` and {r:list}`devel`.

We recommend all new developers use the current development (unreleased)
version, which is currently @rtems-ver-major@. The
{ref}`Quick Start Preparation <QuickStartPreparation>` should be
consulted for guidance. Some examples shown may use released versions,
which may not be recommended for your purposes. If you are unsure, feel free to
inquire in the {r:url}`discord` or on the {r:list}`devel`.

You will likely encounter the least difficulty by using a GNU/Linux
environment, which could be in a virtual machine, for example that uses
[Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and should run on most modern
desktop systems. You should also be able to work with a MacOS or Windows
system, but might encounter more challenges. See the detailed guidance in
{ref}`development-host`.

Setting up a development environment consists of the following steps.

1. Installing dependencies for your host operating system.
2. Choosing an installation prefix.
3. Downloading the source code.
4. Installing the tool suite.
5. Building the Board Support Package (BSP).
6. Testing the Board Support Package (BSP).

## Installing Dependencies

You need tools for your hostâ€™s operating system to build the RTEMS tool suite
from source. Please have a look at the {ref}`host-computer` chapter for the
instructions to install the tools for your OS.

## Choosing an installation prefix

The term `prefix` refers to the path on your computer where the software is
to be installed. You can refer to the {ref}`Prefix <QuickStartPrefixes>`
section for details on choosing an installation prefix. You should avoid using
prefixes that require root permission, as building with root is not supported
or recommended.

## Downloading the Sources

We will be using Git to clone the sources for RTEMS and RSB. This is the
preferred way if you are planning to make contributions to the RTEMS project.

Please refer to the {ref}`QuickStartSources_Git` section for instructions on
obtaining sources using Git.

## Installing the Tool Suite

The Tools suite is the collection of tools required to build the BSP. This
includes the compiler, debugger, assembler and other tools. These tools are
architecture-specific. We will be installing the SPARC tool suite since we are
building a SPARC based BSP.

Please refer to the {ref}`QuickStartTools` section for instructions on
building and installing the tool suite. Remember to use the current version
associated with the RTEMS development head, see
{ref}`QuickStartPreparation_Version`. You do not need to create a toolchain
archive, but you should read the rest of the {ref}`Quick Start <QuickStart>`
while your tools build.

## Building the Board Support Package

There are two ways of building a BSP. We could either ask RSB to build the BSP
or manually build it. You will build it manually.
Please refer the {ref}`QuickStartBSPBuild_Manual` section for the
instructions.

## Testing the Board Support Package

Testing is an essential part of RTEMS development process. The main reason for
choosing the SPARC erc32 BSP is that it has very good simulator support. This
will allow you to test your changes without the need for SPARC hardware.

Please refer to {ref}`QuickStartBSPTest` for instructions on testing the BSP.

## Prove You Can Work On RTEMS

This section is intended for contributors interested in Google Summer of Code.

You have to finish the following task to prove that you can work on RTEMS.

Modify the hello world example to include a new different print statement.
Something like "Hello from The Dark Side!". Then send us enough to prove to us
that you did this. We want to know you can work with RTEMS.

Create a Merge Request (MR) of your changes and submit it along with a
screenshot of the output from running your modified hello world in the
simulator.

If you followed this guide, this hello world modification will likely need to be
made in `$HOME/quick-start/src/rtems/testsuites/samples/hello/init.c`.
To test your changes, you have to build the BSP again, something like the
following:

```none
cd $HOME/quick-start/src/rtems
./waf
```

If you are happy with your changes you can commit the changes and submit the MR.

## Creating and Sending Merge Requests

Before sending an MR, make sure that the changes you have made conforms to
RTEMS coding standards.
You can refer to {ref}`Contributing` section for instruction on creating and
sending merge requests.

Here are a few pointers to keep in mind while creating the patches.

- Make sure not to commit changes in the `main` branch. This is to avoid
  merge conflicts when you are pulling the latest changes from the remote
  branch.
- Avoid trailing whitespace errors.
- Avoid making random whitespace changes unrelated to your changes.
- The author name of the patch is your full legal name.
- The author email of the patch is your valid email address.
- Ensure that your changeset builds before sending the MR for review.
