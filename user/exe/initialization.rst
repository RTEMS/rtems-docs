BSP Initialization
==================
.. index:: BSP Initialization

The bootloader jumps or calls the RTEMS executable's entry point, normally a
fixed address. The BSP entry point or start up code performs:

#. Low level processor specific initialization that such as setting control
   registers so the processor is operating in a mode RTEMS is built for

#. Cache flushing, clearing and invalidation

#. Memory management unit (MMU) set up if required

#. Clear the uninitialized data section

#. Process a command line if supported by the bootloader

#. Call ``bootcard`` which disabled interrupts, saves away a command line if
   the BSP supports it then call the RTEMS kernel early initialize entry point
   ``rtems_initialize_executive``. This call never returns.

Further BSP initialization happens as part of RTEMS kernel's System
Initialization process. The following handlers are declared and if provided are
placed at the beginning of the initialization handler list. The BSP can
provides:

``bsp_work_area_initialize``
  This function determines the amount of memory that can be given to RTEMS for
  the workspace and the C library heap which ``malloc`` uses. The call
  typically uses the ``bsp_work_area_initialize_default`` to perform actually
  perform the initialization.

``bsp_start``
  This function is specialized for each architecture and even for some BSPs. It
  performs the low level initialization RTEMS needs so it can run on the
  architecture and BSP.

``bsp_predriver_hook``
  This function can be used to initialize hardware drivers depend on such as
  configuring an interrupt controller. The default version is empty and does
  nothing.

BSPs all perform similar operations with common functionality and the RTEMS
kernel provides common code that can be shared between BSPs. The use of the
common code is encouraged for all new BSPs.

RTEMS Initialization
====================
.. index:: RTEMS Initialization

The RTEMS kernel initialization is:

#. Invoke the registered system initialization handlers

#. Set the system state to **up**

#. If the kernel supports SMP request multitasking start. All online cores are
   transferred to the **ready to start multitasking** state.

#. Start threaded multitasking. RTEMS starts multitasking by getting the first
   thread to run and dispatching it.

C++ static object constructors are called in the context of the first running
thread before the thread body is entered.

System Initialization Handlers
------------------------------

RTEMS supports the automatic registration of services used in
applications. This method of initialization automatically configures RTEMS with
only the services used in an application. There is no manual configuration of
services used and no updating of initialization function tables.

RTEMS uses specialized sections in the ELF executable to perform this task. The
system is based on the `FreeBSD SYSINT Framework
<https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/books/arch-handbook/sysinit.html>`_. Ordered
initialization is performed before multitasking is started.

The RTEMS Tool ``rtems-exeinfo`` can provide some detail about the registered
handlers. The following shows the initialization handlers for the Hello World
sample application in the RTEMS kernel's testsuite:

.. code-block:: none

 $ rtems-exeinfo --init arm-rtems@rtems-ver-major@/c/xilinx_zynq_zedboard/testsuites/samples/hello.exe

The section ``.rtemsroset`` lists the handlers called in order. The handlers
can be split into the BSP initialization handlers that start the BSP:

- ``bsp_work_area_initialize``
- ``bsp_start``
- ``zynq_debug_console_init``
- ``rtems_counter_sysinit``

And the remainder are handlers for services used by the application. The list
varies based on the services the application uses.
