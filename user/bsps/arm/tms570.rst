This BSP family supports the two evaluation boards:

* `Hercules TMS570LC43x Development Kit <https://www.ti.com/tool/TMDX570LC43HDK>`__

* `Hercules TMS570LS31x/21x Development Kit <https://www.ti.com/tool/TMDS570LS31HDK>`__

BSP build options allow you to customize the BSP variants.  The

* ``tms570lc4357_hdk``

* ``tms570ls3137_hdk``

BSP variants use the internal flash for code, the internal SRAM for data, and
perform a basic system initialization including setting up the SDRAM
controller.  The

* ``tms570lc4357_hdk_sdram``

* ``tms570ls3137_hdk_sdram``

do not use the internal flash and use the SDRAM for code and data.  They
rely on a basic system initialization.
