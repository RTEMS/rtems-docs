# Qemu Xilinx Versal

This BSP supports three variants: `versal-qemu`, `versal-aiedge` and
`versal-vck190`. The basic hardware initialization is performed by the
BSP. These BSPs support the GICv3 interrupt controller present in the Xilinx
Versal Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP) systems. The BSPs
currently only work when started in the secure mode.

## Boot via ELF

The executable image is booted by Qemu in ELF format.

## Clock Driver

The clock driver uses the `ARM Generic Timer`.

## Console Driver

The console driver supports the default Qemu emulated ARM PL011 PrimeCell UART.
There are some differences between the PL011 and the UART used by actual Versal
ACAP hardware systems.

## Running Executables

Executables generated by these BSPs can be run using the following command:

qemu-system-aarch64 -no-reboot -nographic -serial mon:stdio
: -machine xlnx-versal-virt -m 4096 -kernel example.exe
