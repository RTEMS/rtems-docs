Commercial Support Services
***************************

The wider RTEMS community has developers and organizations who can provide
commercial support services. These services range from training, implementing
new features in RTEMS, deployment of RTEMS, helping establish a new project
environment for a team, to application and system design.

The RTEMS Project does not endorse or promote any provider of these services
and we recommend you use a search engine to locate a suitable provider. If you
are unsure please contact a provider and see what is available.

If you develop a new feature or you have someone do this for you we recommend
you have the work submitted to the project and merged. Once accepted into the
project the work will be maintained as part of the development process within
the project and this is a benefit for.
