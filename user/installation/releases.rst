Releases
========
.. index:: tarball
.. index:: release

RTEMS releases provide a stable version of the kernel for the supported
architectures. RTEMS maintaines the current and previous releases. Support for
older releases is provided using the RTEMS support channels.

Please read :ref:`development-host` before continuing. 

You need to select a location to build and install the RTEMS Tool chain and
RTEMS. Make sure there is plenty of disk space and a fast disk is
recommended. Our procedure will document building and installing the tools in a
base directory called :file:`/opt/rtems`. This path will require root
access. If you are working on a machine you do not have root access to you can
use a home directory, If building on Windows use :file:`/c/opt/rtems` to keep
the top level paths as short as possible. :ref:`windows-path-length` provides
more detail about path lengths on Windows.

The location used to install the tools and kernel is called the `prefix`.
:ref:`QuickStartPrefixes` explains prefixes and how to use them. 
Released versions of the RTEMS Source Builder (RSB) download all source code
for all packages from the :r:url:`ftp` rather than from the package's home
site. Hosting all the source on the :r:url:`ftp` ensures the source is present
for the life of the release on the :r:url:`ftp`. If there is a problem
accessing the RTEMS FTP the RSB will fall back to the packages home site.

The :r:url:`ftp` is hosted at the Oregon State University's The Open Source Lab
(http://osuosl.org/). This is a nonprofit organization working for the
advancement of open source technologies and RTEMS is very fortunate to be
shosted here. It has excellent internet access and performance.

.. note:: **Controlling the RTEMS Kernel Build**

   Building RSB releases by default does not build the RTEMS kernel. To build
   the RTEMS kernel add the ``--with-rtems`` option to the RSB command line.

   By default all the BSPs for an architecture are built. If you only wish to
   have a specific BSP built you can specify the BSP list by providing to the
   RSB the option ``--with-rtemsbsp``. For example to build two BSPs for the
   SPARC architecture you can supply ``--with-rtemsbsp="erc32 leon3"``. This can
   speed the build time up for some architectures that have a lot of BSPs.

Once you have built the tools and kernel you can move to the Packages section
of the manual.

RTEMS Tools and Kernel
----------------------

This procedure will build a SPARC tool chain. Set up a suitable workspace to
build the release in. On Unix:

.. code-block:: none

 $ cd
 $ mkdir -p development/rtems/releases
 $ cd development/rtems/releases

If building on Windows:

.. code-block:: none

 $ cd /c
 $ mkdir -p opt/rtems
 $ cd opt/rtems

**Note** the paths on Windows will be different to those shown.

Download the RTEMS Source Builder (RSB) from the RTEMS FTP server:

.. code-block:: none

 $ wget https://ftp.rtems.org/pub/rtems/releases/@rtems-ver-major@/@rtems-ver-majminrev@/rtems-source-builder-@rtems-ver-majminrev@.tar.xz

On Unix unpack the RSB release tar file using:

.. code-block:: none

 $ tar Jxf rtems-source-builder-@rtems-ver-majminrev@.tar.xz
 $ cd rtems-source-builder-@rtems-ver-majminrev@/rtems/

On Windows you need to shorten the path (See :ref:`windows-path-length`) after
you have unpacked the tar file:

.. code-block:: none

 $ tar Jxf rtems-source-builder-@rtems-ver-majminrev@.tar.xz
 $ mv rtems-source-builder-@rtems-ver-majminrev@ @rtems-ver-majminrev@
 $ cd @rtems-ver-majminrev@

Build a tool chain for the SPARC architecure. We are using the SPARC
architecture in our example because GDB has a good simulator that lets us run
and test the samples RTEMS builds by default

If building on Windows add ``--jobs=none`` to avoid GNU make issues on Windows
discussed in :ref:`msys2_parallel_builds`.

.. code-block:: none

 $ ../source-builder/sb-set-builder \
     --prefix=/opt/rtems/@rtems-ver-major@ @rtems-ver-major@/rtems-sparc

You can now build a third-party library or an application as defaulted in TBD.
